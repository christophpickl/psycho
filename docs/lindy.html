                <ul>
                    <li><b>The Hands</b>: Leader palm facing up, follower resting inside, 4 fingers have a sponge-spring quality (connecting the frame; enough tension so no need to squeeze; &quot;shape locks together&quot;), thumbs are free (don't squeeze the thumbs!). The arms holding the hands are totally relaxed, hanging like noodles.</li>
                    <li><b>The Frame</b>: The torso, upper body, the part between shoulders and hips (also called &quot;ships&quot;) which stays upright and doesn't collapse. It must be connected to the arms to communicate arm movements throught the whole body.</li>
                    <li><b>The Rhythms</b>: 6-count, 8-count, Charleston, ...</li>
                    <li><b>The Quality</b>: Considering it's an African diasporic dance, it's more lively (less upright ballroom European stiff) and danced to big band jazz with a lot of bouncy energy.</li>
                    <li><b>The Footwork</b>: Staying in place, traveling (default), moving in/out (rock-step with lateral).</li>
                    <li><b>On Leading</b>: Every move/technique is announced slightly before, so the leader stays always a bit ahead, and executes the plan with certainty to not surprise the follower.</li>
                    <li>The body moves the legs, not the other way round; move as one unit; the upper body leads.</li>

                <h2 id="Basics_History">History</h2>
                <p>
                    Lindy Hop is an African American dance, which started in New York, Harlem during the late 1920s in conjunction with swing jazz.
                    Its predecessor is Charleston (timing, footwork), its successor is Rock'n'Roll.<br/>
                    It is not entirely clear when and how <b>the name</b> was coined, but a fun story is that the pilot's nickname who first did a transatlantic flight was &quot;Lindy&quot;, and he &quot;hopped&quot; overseas. Once a dancer was asked what he was doing, he quickly replied based on that headline: &quot;Lindy Hop&quot;.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>When having difficulties with your steps: <b>Verbalizing</b> helps, making sounds, counting the rhythm, to bodily internalize it. It's really a thing as research shows. Either counting with numbers, or saying the quick-quick-slow, or be more creative with &quot;shroom-bap-bom-de-bap&quot;.</li>
                    <li>Listen to <b>the music</b>, follow the 4/8th pattern and keep your moves in sync with it.</li>
                    <li>Give <b>feedback</b> to your partner, but don't criticize them. Show compassion, support and patience while doing so. Don't let your own inner critic also affect your partner. When in doubt, just say nothing, or ask for permission to give feedback. Formulate questions instead of commands. And when there are conflicting opinions, curiously explore and research both possibilities; ultimate ask your teacher, as s/he is always right ;)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Some tips on how to improve for you <b>personally</b>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feel free to move as <b>no one is watching</b>, because frankly: It is very, very likely that this is actually the case. Research shows, that many of us are afraid that we are being observed and judged; yet, if everyone has that concern, there is no one left to observe, because everyone is busy with themselves.</li>
                    <li>Just <b>fuck it</b>! Seriously, develop an attitude of caring less, considering we all started to dance to feel pleasure, and not struggle and stress ourselves out to be good. It will help you to relax, to soften, and thus things will work actually even better. Just listen to the music and enjoy the dance.</li>
                    <li>Similar to the attitude of fewer expectations of performing, the attention on the <b>breath</b> can help to soften the body and free one's mind to (paradoxically) improve performance. Do a quick body-scan: Let your chest sink in, bend your knees, center your pelvis, feel the ground underneath your feet. Especially when facing a new, unknown partner, stress levels can go high due to nervousness. Getting off-beat, making mistakes. Simply recover with a smile/laughter, or start from new, reset.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Guidelines for attending <b>socials</b>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In our community, we give each other honest <b>feedback</b> and talk things through.</li>
                    <li>We value <b>hygiene</b>, good smells, and fresh shirts.</li>
                    <li>We <b>approach</b> each other to ask for a dance, are free to say &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; and stop the dance if we feel to do so.</li>
                    <li>We <b>start slowly</b> with a new partner, maybe weight shift to more complex techniques, going through a mental checklist, building it up, and sketching a picture.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- =============================================================================================== -->
                <h3 id="Basics_Position_Closed">Closed Position</h3>
                <p>
                    The closed-position is called that way, because the partners are <b>standing closer to each other</b>, side-by-side, shoulders touching.<br/>
                    The leader has his <b>arm</b> around the waist, the follower on the (usually closer) shoulder blade, or somewhere on the back, or even on the arm, depending on the height difference, but definitely not on top of the shoulder!
                    Pay attention that the arms have a connection, that there is no gap in between.
                </p>
                <h3 id="Basics_Position_Open">Open Position</h3>
                <p>
                    During the open-position, the partners stand in front of each other, further away, thus open.
                    The basic-step can be either done in the same or in the opposite direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The leaders left <b>hand</b> (palm upwards, fingers inwards) holds the followers right hand (palm downwards, fingers also inwards).
                    The connecting arm is very relaxed, really hanging down (in contrast to the free arm, which act's like a &quot;wing&quot;, always up, hip height, ready for action), and is used to give directions to the follower when wanting to travel.<br/>
                    You can also change your hand, as a leader use the right (instead of the left) hand and have them in a &quot;shake hand position&quot; but without using the thumbs!<br/>
                    In the closed-position the hand-connection is optional, during the open-position it is (more) mandatory, as it is the only (physical) connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dare to <b>play around</b> in the open position, be creative, explore and research freely, there is a lot possible here.
                    Travel around, change places by passing by either left or right (keep the arm low), or do a turn by lifting the arm, to make the difference really clear. Sometimes a change in direction/traveling can be misinterpreted as a pass-by... well, it's ok :)
                </p>

                <h2 id="Basics_Steps">Steps</h2>
                <!-- =============================================================================================== -->
                <p>
                    We usually step something we call &quot;quick&quot; (one beat) or &quot;slow&quot; (two beats).
                    The slow-step (also called <i>groove-walk</i>) is a simplified version of the triple-step.
                    The quick-steps come in pairs, also called <i>rock-steps</i>.
                    The stepping pattern comes in two flavors: 6-count and 8-count.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep a <b>bounce</b> and bend the (soft) knees, relax your arms, breathe, and look forward (not down).
                    For the slow-step (without triples) we do two bounces (connect to the music).<br />
                    Slightly <b>lean forward</b> with your upper body, and also keep most of the weight on the front part of the foot.
                    The heels hover a tiny bit over the ground, using the achilles tendon to bounce.<br />
                    <b>Turn</b> your direction while doing the basic step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When in closed position, we always start with outer leg.
                    When in open position, the leg starts where the hands are holding.
                    Or phrased differently: &quot;<i>Leader always starts left, because follower is always right.</i>&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <b>triple-step</b> is done in a &quot;W-shape&quot; (not M), meaning to go down into the ground.
                    You keep standing on a spot, and not move sideways.
                    Keep the bounce throughout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tip on how to <b>indicate starting</b>: Of course, keep the bounce, and additionally to that shift the weight medial, so the follower's outer leg is free. Take a deep breath in, lift your center up, and once you want to go, breathe out and lower in a U-shape backwards to make it crystal clear.<br/>
                    Or when starting in open position, first go down a bit, like in a U-shape, then go back and push arm forward.

                    <b>Mixing them</b>: When in closed position, you can, for example, do an 8-count, then switch to an open position and do an 6-count.

                <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
                <p>Simply repeating the same stepping parts on the (semi) spot. For this, it is crucial to have a good, strong connection with your partner: Follower's elbow pushed inwards, leader's embrace harm tight; don't be shy to give a clear push/pull.<br/>
                    Different possibilities are available:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While being at the <b>back/rock-step</b> (open position), instead of a slow-step, stay on the spot and hover the leg in front.</li>
                    <li>While being at the <b>front/5-6</b> (open position), repeat the quick-quick-steps. The outer leg stays on the spot still is lifted a bit when the weight is shifted off; and the inner leg constantly moves back and forth (no slow-step). To stop the repeater, make the back-step quick-step into a slow-step. Also, while the repeater-quick-step keeps the more to the front, and the leader is being given a slight impulse forward ("stop"), when stopping, the whole body is moved backwards, and an impulse to move backwards is given ("go").</li>
                    <li>While being in the <b>closed position</b>, we do a similar step pattern as with being in the front open position. Be clear as a leader to "zap" at the edges with your arms, and to rotate the partner back in to go back to the open position. Here either <b>leader or follower</b> in front will change how steps and who stays.</li>
                    <li>There are also <b>oppositions</b> where we go counter back-and-forth, yet with the same quality of repeaters.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When the music is not playing (it has a break), we can stand still on the spot. We do so at the back-most position (stay on back-leg, the 2nd quick-step), and indicate by being upright with the upper body (instead of leaning forward).</p>

                    Also called &quot;change positions&quot; (nomen est omen), where we start in the open position and do an async basic-step (opposite direction). Leader raises arm straight up, doing an internal rotation (as if would look at the watch) on the 2nd count/quick, and rotating the follower CCW.<br/>
                    Remember to do small steps (otherwise end up too far away from each other), and to not cross your steps.

                <p>To indicate first externally rotate a bit, and then both rotate 90 degrees (half-turn) towards the partner, opening &quot;their wings&quot;. Try to start with left and right leg, as well as clockwise and counter-clockwise.</p>
                <p>Here is a nice possibility to change the roles; just watch out to get the hand position right by putting the leader's arm underneath first.</p>

                <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
                <p>A send-out is basically moving from closed- to open-position, with either leader or follower in front.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To send out the <b>follower</b>, the leader stays on the spot and slightly pulls with the left hand.
                        Rotate your torso towards the follower, and push with your right hand to rotate the follower and make her step in front of you.</li>
                    <li>The <b>leader</b> send-out is done by first indicating to the follower to stay on the spot (otherwise tricky traveling far), and then move in front; continue with the basic-step or move back again to a side-by-side position.</li>

                    After the starting rock-step, break the footwork, connect the hip of your partner, and draw a circle (preferably CCW as this seems easier).
                    To start again (exit), simply enter with a rock-step.

                <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
                <p>We both turn -usually CW, as it is easier-, with the pivot point between of us, thus both really move, not one around the other. We give each other counter-balance (shift your weight really back, with pelvis and not with upper body only), and touch each other's shoulder blade; not the waist, don't grab/pull there.</p>
                <p>Enter on the rock-step and already start to turn your follower.</p>
                <p>Exit: Finish the 8th count and go back to basics with a triple-step.</p>

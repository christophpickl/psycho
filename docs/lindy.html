                <p>
                    Lindy Hop is an African American dance, which started in New York, Harlem during the late 1920s in conjunction with swing jazz.
                    Its predecessor is Charleston (timing, footwork), its successor is Rock'n'Roll.<br/>
                    It is not entirely clear when and how <b>the name</b> was coined, but a fun story is that the pilot's nickname who first did a transatlantic flight was &quot;Lindy&quot;, and he &quot;hopped&quot; overseas. Once a dancer was asked what he was doing, he quickly replied based on that headline: &quot;Lindy Hop&quot;.
                </p>

                </div>

                <h2 id="Basics_Advice">General Advice</h2>
                <!-- =============================================================================================== -->
                <ul>
                    <li><b>The Bounce</b>: The importance of keeping a continuous, clear bounce cannot be overestimated. It is the one and only thing that keeps the dance alive, like the heart beating to keeping us alive. It also helps to maintain the connection with your partner, to (obviously) stay on-beat, and it simply helps to make the moves easier smoother.</li>
                    <li><b>The Hands</b>: Leader palm facing up, follower resting inside, 4 fingers have a sponge-spring quality (connecting the frame; enough tension so no need to squeeze; &quot;shape locks together&quot;, like LEGO hands, hooking, firm shape which can also be pushed into), thumbs are free (don't squeeze the thumbs!). The arms holding the hands are totally relaxed, hanging like noodles.<br/>
                    Alternatively, there is a <b>ballroom</b> hand position, fingers pointing up, like a two-right-hands-handshake in standard dances.<br/>
                        Speaking of handshake: the <b>crossed-hand</b> position has both using the same hand in a handshake position but without using the thumb.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>The Frame</b>: The connection of the arms to the whole upper body; the part between shoulders and hips (also called &quot;ships&quot;) which stays upright and doesn't collapse. It must be connected to the arms to communicate arm movements through the whole body.</li>
                    <li><b>The Rhythms</b>: 6-count, 8-count, Charleston, ...</li>
                    <li><b>The Quality</b>: Considering it's an African diasporic dance, it's more lively (less upright ballroom European stiff) and danced to big band jazz with a lot of bouncy energy.</li>
                    <li><b>The Footwork</b>: Staying in place, traveling (default), moving in/out (rock-step with lateral).</li>
                    <li><b>The Connection</b>: We have an elastic connection, which can stretch, like a rubber band or bamboo. This compression can happen on both arms, the one where the hands touch, or the arm connects to the back. The pressure builds up gradually, slowly (instead of sharply which can come as a surprise). The limbs are connected to the frame, strong yet soft and not hard/rigid or collapsed/unstable.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Partnered Up</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give <b>feedback</b> to your partner, but don't criticize them. Show compassion, support and patience while doing so. Don't let your own inner critic also affect your partner. When in doubt, just say nothing, or ask for permission to give feedback (&quot;<i>Hey, I noticed something. Are you open for some feedback?</i>&quot;). Formulate questions/suggestions instead of commands (&quot;<i>How about we try to do this or that?</i>&quot;), and always round it up with some words of encouragement (&quot;<i>Well done! That feels much better for me now.</i>&quot;).<br/>
                    Be especially aware of these things when you are <b>more experienced</b> and dance with someone who is less. To not overwhelm with corrections, feedback and pointing out all the things that he is doing wrong. Sometimes it's also good to let them experience and learn by themselves -the best teacher of all.<br/>
                        Lastly, when there are conflicting opinions, curiously explore and research both possibilities; ultimate ask your teacher, as s/he is always right ;)</li>
                    <li>To better lead, enhance the signals you give via your <b>body language</b>. Never underestimate the importance of leaning (forward/backward), shifting your weight (fully), and moving the whole body (as a unit). The embracing arm should give an &quot;elastic signal&quot; and the upper arms are connected/touching without a gap.</li>
                    <li>Practice <b>honestly</b> with your partner. Don't try to be overly nice and polite, not hurting the other person's feeling, by doing something (expecting it, maybe due to the instructions) even though it has not been signaled by the leader. Respond only to what has been indicated, so if there is no push, you don't walk. Faking it will give your partner maybe a good short-term feeling, but will harm him more in the long run.</li>
                    <li><b>Leaders</b> always anticipate: Be always half a step ahead, have a clear intention, a typical leadership skill. Know what you are going to do next, have it already ready in your head, plan ahead. Possibly even do a counter-move before as a signal that something is coming their way.<br/>
                    <b>Followers</b> never anticipate: Be always half a step behind, that's just part of the game. Be open, surrender to the moment and listen carefully.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Technical</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When having difficulties with your steps: <b>Verbalizing</b> helps, making sounds, counting the rhythm, to bodily internalize it. It's really a thing as research shows. Either counting with numbers, or saying the quick-quick-slow, or be more creative with &quot;shroom-bap-bom-de-bap&quot;.</li>
                    <li>Listen to <b>the music</b>, follow the 4/8th pattern and keep your moves in sync with it.</li>
                    <li>As a <b>tall follower</b>, make yourself smaller, so a (potentially smaller) leader can reach above your head (or at least doesn't have to go too much on their toes).</li>
                    <li>Be <b>engaged</b> with all your body: Your face (smile), your inactive arm (reach it; no dead fish arms), and of course the most important bounce.</li>
                    <li><b>Reach</b> for your follower with your arm when returning/sending-in, so she knows a bit in advance what's going to happen/your intention.</li>
                    <li>When <b>leading</b>, every move/technique is announced slightly <b>before</b>, so the leader stays always a bit ahead, and executes the plan with certainty to not surprise the follower.</li>
                    <li>The <b>body moves</b> the legs, not the other way round; move as one unit from your center/upper body (otherwise the follower will feel nothing).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Beginner's Mistakes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Squeezing</b> the hand, especially using the thumb, instead of a relaxed 4-finger-connection only.</li>
                    <li>Having stiff, <b>tensed arms</b>, instead of having them hang as loosely as possible.</li>
                    <li><b>Pushing/pulling</b> from the <b>hand/arm</b>/shoulder only, instead of pushing from the frame connection by moving/rotating the whole (upper-)body.</li>
                    <li><b>Bounce upwards</b>, almost hopping, or not bouncing at all, instead of bouncing down into the ground.</li>
                    <li>Having the hand on top of the leader's <b>shoulder</b>, instead of on the back.</li>
                    <li><b>Looking down</b> at the feet, instead looking into the space or smiling at your partner.</li>
                    <li>Holding your <b>breath</b>, instead of letting your breath relax your body.</li>
                    <li>Not enjoying it by having too high <b>expectations</b>, instead of just doing it and failing fantastically with some laughter.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Improve Personally</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feel free to move as <b>no one is watching</b>, because frankly: It is very, very likely that this is actually the case. Research shows, that many of us are afraid that we are being observed and judged; yet, if everyone has that concern, there is no one left to observe, because everyone is busy with themselves.</li>
                    <li>Just <b>fuck it</b>! Seriously, develop an attitude of caring less, considering we all started to dance to feel pleasure, and not struggle and stress ourselves out to be good. It will help you to relax, to soften, and thus things will work actually even better. Just listen to the music and enjoy the dance.</li>
                    <li>Don't strive for perfection, because with Swing Dance mistakes happen all the time, so don't even try to seek it. Just be active together, communicate, and do the best as you can, and practice recovery strategies.</li>
                    <li>Similar to the attitude of fewer expectations of performing, the attention on the <b>breath</b> can help to soften the body and free one's mind to (paradoxically) improve performance. Do a quick body-scan: Let your chest sink in, bend your knees, center your pelvis, feel the ground underneath your feet. Especially when facing a new, unknown partner, stress levels can go high due to nervousness. Getting off-beat, making mistakes. Simply recover with a smile/laughter, or start from new, reset.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Most important is that your <b>shoes</b> don't have too much grip. Something that is maybe useful for some other movement practices, but with Lindy Hop, we want to be able to turn and twist on the ground. When there is too much grip, a lot of force will be exerted on your knee joints, which they will not like, at all! Flat sole without a profile, or even a leather sole (which your favorite shoemaker can attach) should give you the &quot;slideyness&quot; necessary to remove any friction while hopping.</li>
                    <li>In general, it must be said that the community (especially at socials) prefers to consider every dance opportunity as a &quot;costume festival&quot; to warp them back into the times of the <b>1920's</b>, and thus wears clothes from that era. But of course, anything that is practical, and you feel comfortable with should suffice.</li>

                <h3 id="Basics_Position_Closed">Closed Position</h3>
                <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
                <p>
                    The closed-position is called that way, because the partners are <b>standing closer to each other</b>, shoulders are &quot;side-by-side&quot;, which also is one of its synonyms.
                    We stand a bit in a V-shape, facing inwards towards each other, and not totally frontal to the front.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The leader has his <b>arm</b> all around the back around <b>waist</b>, or a bit higher up, on the back.
                    The follower has her hand on the <b>shoulder blade</b> which is closer to her.
                    Depending on <b>height/size difference</b>, it might need to move somewhere else on the back, or even onto the upper arm, but definitely not (!) on top of the shoulder.
                    Also pay attention that the arms have a connection so that there is <b>no gap</b> in between.
                </p>

                <h3 id="Basics_Position_Open">Open Position</h3>
                <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
                <p>
                    During the open-position, the partners stand in front of each other, further away, thus open.
                    <!-- Important here is, that in the closed position you can do either an 8- or a 6-count basic step (see below).
                    Whereas in the open position, we are confined to a 6-count only.-->
                    The basic-step can be either done in the same or in the opposite direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The leaders left <b>hand</b> (palm upwards, fingers inwards) holds the followers right hand (palm downwards, fingers also inwards).
                    The connecting arm is very relaxed, really hanging down (in contrast to the free arm, which act's like a &quot;wing&quot;, always up, hip height, ready for action), and is used to give directions to the follower when wanting to travel.<br/>
                    You can also change your hand, as a leader use the right (instead of the left) hand and have them in a &quot;shake hand position&quot; but without using the thumbs!<br/>
                    In the closed-position the hand-connection is optional, during the open-position it is (more) mandatory, as it is the only (physical) connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dare to <b>play around</b> in the open position, be creative, explore and research freely, there is a lot possible here.
                    Travel around, <a href="#Basics_Positioning_Passby">change places</a> by passing by either left or right (keep the arm low), or do a turn by lifting the arm, to make the difference really clear. Sometimes a change in direction/traveling can be misinterpreted as a pass-by... well, it's ok :)
                </p>

                <h2 id="Basics_Steps">Steps</h2>
                <!-- =============================================================================================== -->
                <p>
                    We usually step something we call &quot;quick&quot; (one beat) or &quot;slow&quot; (two beats).
                    The slow-step (also called <i>groove-walk</i>) is a simplified version of the triple-step.
                    The quick-steps come in pairs, also called &quot;<i>rock-steps</i>&quot;.
                    The stepping pattern comes in two flavors: 6-count and 8-count.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep a <b>bounce</b> and bend the (soft) knees, relax your arms, breathe, and look forward (not down).
                    For the slow-step (without triples) we do two bounces (connect to the music).<br />
                    Slightly <b>lean forward</b> with your upper body, and also keep most of the weight on the front part of the foot.
                    The heels hover a tiny bit over the ground, using the achilles tendon to bounce.<br />
                    <b>Turn</b> your direction while doing the basic step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dance is done from the center, the core, the pelvis area, and not from the legs or arms.
                    When doing the rock-step, initiate it by your center, really shifting your weight and moving the whole body as a unit.
                    Don't just move your legs and keep the rest of the body in the same position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When in closed position, we always start with outer leg.
                    When in open position, the leg starts where the hands are holding.
                    Put differently: &quot;<i>Leader always starts left, because follower is always right.</i>&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technically, we can differentiate between a linear and a <b>rotational rock-step</b>.
                    The first is the default, whereas the second is used for rotating, to send out the follower, to give her a bit of a spin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tip on how to <b>indicate starting</b>: Of course, keep the bounce, and additionally to that shift the weight medial, so the follower's outer leg is free. Take a deep breath in, lift your center up, and once you want to go, breathe out and lower in a U-shape backwards to make it crystal clear.<br/>
                    Or when starting in open position, first go down a bit, like in a U-shape, then go back and push arm forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the basic steps (6-count, 8-count) there is surprisingly much to do already, which requires a very good connection between the partners to properly communicate the changes (this is already rather advanced).
                    The combination of repeaters and walks (single steps/groove-walk, or triples), 6/8-count and closed/open-position alone can be combined in complex patterns.
                </p>

                    <b>Exercise:</b><br/>
                    Stand in front of each other without any touch, and try to synchronize each other's movement with visual cues only, reading the body language and emphasizing shift weight and leaning. Introduce some breaks and repeaters, maybe even switch count steps or triples and grooves and enjoy the ride.

                <p>
                    The <b>triple-step</b> is done in a &quot;W-shape&quot; not M; meaning: Going down into the ground, not upwards; actually with all our steps, as they keep a bounce into the ground.
                    Try to keep standing on the spot (or deliberately &quot;travel&quot;), letting the grove go vertical downwards, and don't move sideways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The triple is done on a so-called &quot;<i>syncopated rhythm</i>&quot; (syncopation = a disturbance/interruption of the regular flow of music).
                    To put it simply: Three steps done within two beats, whereas the second step in the middle is a bit delayed and closer to the third.
                    The two beats indeed also have two bounces.<br/>
                    Because it squeezes multiple steps into a short timeframe, the triple-step can only be done on slower songs; for faster ones we need to use the groove-walk again.
                </p>

                <p>Simply repeating the same stepping parts on the (semi) spot. For this, it is crucial to have a good, strong connection with your partner: Follower's elbow pushed inwards, leader's embrace harm tight; don't be shy to give a clear push/pull.<br/>
                    Different possibilities are available:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While being at the <b>back/rock-step</b> (open position), instead of a slow-step, stay on the spot and hover the leg in front.</li>
                    <li>While being at the <b>front/5-6</b> (open position), repeat the quick-quick-steps. The outer leg stays on the spot still is lifted a bit when the weight is shifted off; and the inner leg constantly moves back and forth (no slow-step). To stop the repeater, make the back-step quick-step into a slow-step. Also, while the repeater-quick-step keeps the more to the front, and the leader is being given a slight impulse forward ("stop"), when stopping, the whole body is moved backwards, and an impulse to move backwards is given ("go").</li>
                    <li>While being in the <b>closed position</b>, we do a similar step pattern as with being in the front open position. Be clear as a leader to "zap" at the edges with your arms, and to rotate the partner back in to go back to the open position. Here either <b>leader or follower</b> in front will change how steps and who stays.</li>
                    <li>There are also <b>oppositions</b> where we go counter back-and-forth, yet with the same quality of repeaters.</li>

                    Just grooving around in some walks (bounce every, and step every second beat), basic steps, doing simple repeaters (when front or back) and breaks, switching 6- and 8-count basic, and also switching triples and grove-walks; just no fancy technical moves.
                    It is used to find/connect to the song and each other, at the beginning of a dance, especially when dancing with a new and unknown partner.
                    It can also be useful as a recovery strategy; a way to (re)start.

                    These are some simple techniques to change your positions/places.
                    It usually involves a pulling force and a few traveling steps, and ending up standing on each other's original spot.

                    Also called &quot;change positions&quot; or &quot;change places&quot; -nomen est omen.
                    We start in an <b>open position</b> and keep, for example, an async (opposite direction) basic-step (6-count feels more comfortable, but 8-count is possible as well).
                    The easiest way to play around here is to simply indicate a change by <b>moving the arm</b> a bit to the left or right, just as if we would indicate a travel-step.
                    Try to also switch into <b>crossed-hand</b> position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The leader <b>raises his arm</b> straight up, internally rotating as if he would look at his watch on the second count/quick-step.
                    The follower goes underneath that arm and rotates 180 degrees CCW.<br/>
                    Remember to do small steps (otherwise end up too far away from each other), and to not cross your steps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, the <b>leader</b> can lift his arm more to the left and walk underneath it himself, turning CCW (with the back towards her), while the follower is still facing him.
                </p>

                    A bit more advanced: When trying to pull back your follower, you can at the very last moment, lift your arm and turn her in <b>the other direction</b> (seems a bit counter-intuitive and surprising at first).

                    In open-position (6-count), we start like doing a simple pass-by, leader going a bit more to the left.
                    The right hand goes over the arms, the left hand letting go of the contact and rotating CCW.
                    Just as with the Soltinho in Zouk, the follower's hand slides over the leader's body (like a belt).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Catching the hand contact again can be a bit tricky, but by keeping the arms up, and sliding and rotating a bit it should work.
                    Alternatively, you can also catch the hand from the inside, ending up in a &quot;wrong&quot; hand position but then quickly fix it with a change places rotation.
                </p>

                <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
                <p>
                    In order to go from open to closed-position, you can continue to pull backwards (by stepping backwards) after the rock-step.
                    This should be enough for the follower to come closer, and with the leader's right arm reached open, it should be visually enough to make the intention clear.
                    Otherwise, the follower can do that herself at any time; no need to have a too rigid &quot;leader leading only&quot; attitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another way is to do a so-called <b>fake change places</b>.
                    The leader raises his arm (as if looking at his watch), but stays on the spot (not changing his place), while the follower continues doing a change places.
                    He reaches early for her back to indicate moving into a closed position.<br/>
                    There is something awkward happening with the arm, as she has to move it around his shoulder. For safety reasons, lead from the hand, raising it high up, and not from the elbow, to not hit your lead in his face with your elbow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Also called (Lindy, not Charleston) &quot;open doors&quot;, is one of the most basic moves there is.
                    To indicate it, first externally rotate a bit with the whole body, but only on the y-axis through the spine, don't bend the upper body; stay upright.
                    This creates a stretch in the arm through the frame, so don't push only with your arm/hand directly, as this will create an uncomfortable, sharp sensation.
                    The follower has as well a small stretch in the shoulder through the hand which is placed on the leader's shoulder blade.
                    Push the followers back a bit, and then both half-turn 180 degrees towards each other, &quot;opening their wings&quot;.<br/>
                    Try to start with left and right leg, as well as clockwise and counter-clockwise.<br/>
                    This is usually done in 8-count basic, as it is not really possible to do it (continuously) in 6-count, as the necessary rock-step is missing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The classical butterfly/open doors is done in the closed-position, whereas sometimes we do it for bigger movements (think of <a href="#Basics_Positioning_Franky6">Franky 6</a>).
                    We turn and push our partner into (subsequent) rotations by moving our whole body (don't push from the arms/hands).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a nice possibility to <b>switch roles</b>, by putting the leader's arm on top (and on the closer shoulder blade) instead underneath the follower's arm.
                </p>

                <h3 id="Basics_Positioning_Sendout">Send-out</h3>
                <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
                <p>
                    A send-out is basically moving from closed- to open-position, with either leader or follower in front.
                    We could therefore also call the opposite move, from closed- to open-position, a &quot;send-in&quot;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To send out the <b>follower</b>, the leader stays on the spot and does a rock-step to the side (or slightly back), rotating the torso towards the follower (CW). With this movement, a stretch/bounce can be created, and with the right arm connected to the frame, an elastic push can be generated.</li>
                    <li>Slightly pull with your left hand and push with your right to rotate the follower and make her step in front of you. Again: Stay on your spot, otherwise she will have difficulties traveling!</li>
                    <li>Watch out: The second rock-step is done backwards (staying on the spot!), and not as usually to the front. Also for the follower: Don't travel too far but maintain the right distance, adjust the steps, as otherwise the stretch on the rock-step is going to over-stretch (losing the frame).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The <b>leader</b> send-out is done by first indicating to the follower to stay on the spot (otherwise tricky traveling far), and then move in front.
                    Continue with the basic-step or move back again to a side-by-side position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <b>variation</b> of it includes a turn CW, by pushing the follower's left side of the back, which might come a bit counter-intuitive and as a surprise at first.
                </p>

                    It's similar to a send-out (also a bit butterfly), but with less of a push, less distance and more connection.
                    We will first cover the version where the follower goes first, as the leader can also go first, just like a send-out, where the leader walks backwards first and then pulls the follower back in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wrapped leader's arm stays on the follower's back while changing position.
                    The follower's arm moves from the back onto the upper arm with a kind of a &quot;dragon mouth open hand&quot;, thus creating a <i>shared frame</i> (a construct across two bodies), to maintain the distance and push lead a bit so not to collide.<br/>
                    With the second rock-step, both continue walking in the same direction (of the follower, which walks backwards), and with the triple-step the leader quickly jumps next to the follower's side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shortened variation, in our school named <b>promenot</b> (as of: not doing the promenade), is pulled back after the first rock-step forward in the open position.
                    It's interrupted by this pull back with the typical stretch-sensation.
                </p>

                <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
                <p>
                    Done in the 6-count basic, starting similar to a regular follower send-out, and with a ballroom hand position.
                    When doing the first rock-step, the leader turns towards the follower, pushing the follower turning away (CW) resulting in a rotational rock step.
                    For that, separate the lower and upper body: Upper body rotates while the pelvis stays facing forward, creating suspension which can be released to turn.
                    Then pulling her back inwards again (CCW), stopping her with a hand-compression on the first triple-step (lots of time there).<br/>
                    On the 2nd triple-step (less time here), let her walk under your lifted arm, creatinga window, by turning her to the other direction and giving a slight push with the right hand on the left side of the back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will either have to change hand-positions (hopefully there is no tight grip between them to enable a rolling point of contact) while turning to end up in the common hand-position during the open-position, or alternatively: Do another turn immediately to &quot;fix&quot; it, either change places or do a send-in back to the closed-position.<br/>
                    Yet another possibility is to right away switch into crossed hands (leader from left to right hand) and go into a <a href="#Basics_Positioning_Franky6">Franky 6</a>.

                1) rotate inwards, rotational rock-step, left elbow pushes into follower
                2) rotate outwards again (similar like with butterfly)
                3) rotate inwards again, release (as leader) right hand and put it on followers' left shoulder blade

                <p>
                    Starting from crossed-hand open-position, using 6-count basic.
                    Instead of the leader's regular linear rock-step, now do a rotational rock-step, pushing the right shoulder forward making the follower turn.
                    Now pull the right arm up, let the follower go underneath it, yet the leader moves most of the distance, ending with his back towards the follower's front.
                    The leader has his right arm on this back, offering his left (palm facing forward) to the follower to hold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From this position, there are three steps: One, rotate inwards with a rotational rock-step, and push with the left elbow into the follower.
                    Two, rotate outwards again, similar to Butterfly. Lastly, rotate inwards again, release the right and and put it on the follower's left shoulder blade.
                </p>
                <p>

                    After the starting rock-step, break the footwork, connect the hip of your partner, and draw a circle (preferably CCW as this seems easier).
                    To start again (exit), simply enter with a rock-step.

                    We both, usually, turn CW, as it is easier.
                    The hand-connection is possible, but not necessary.
                    The rock-steps are only regular steps and not really shifting the weight fully backward/forward.
                    On those, also most of the circle motion happening.<br/>
                    <i>Both</i> really have to move around a pivot point between them, not just one is moving around the other.
                    We give each other counter-balance, so shift your weight really back, with the butt (requires some core strength) and not with upper-body only.
                    Touch each other's shoulder blade, not the waist, and don't grab or pull there; the follower has also a strong connection to the frame through the arm here (valid in general, but here especially).<br/>
                    If you get dizzy, simply do it a bit more, as more practice will get your body used to it, and it'll improve over time.

                    Practice the entering and exit properly, as this might pose the biggest difficulty.
                    Enter on the rock-step and already start to turn your follower, providing some space for her and indicating early enough what's about to come.<br/>
                    After 8 counts, a 360-degree circle should be completed, and the last triple-steps should be pulled straight back (not rotational anymore) to go back into basic, facing in the original direction.
                    Alternatively, a <b>release</b> into the open position is possible and from there immediately back into the circle.

                    You can make it a bit more &quot;spicy&quot; by adding a tuck turn from within the circle.
                    Watch out to switch shortly into a 6-count-basic for the duration of the tuck turn and then back into a 8-counta gain.

                    A bit like a send-out first, but then the leader steps really forward while the follower does her rock-step backwards.
                    Ensure to create a big, gradually increasing stretch effect, instead of a quick/sudden pull.
                    The leader's hand slides to the other side of her back (from right to left).
                    The follower jumps forward and turns 180 degrees CCW, the leader jumps backwards.
                    To increase the dramatic effect, bend your knees deep and throw up your arms.
                    To exit it again, bounce a few beats, wait for the right entrance on the music, and continue in open position.

                <!-- =============================================================================================== -->

                <p>
                    Charleston is embedded within Lindy Hop, its footwork, and has its own set of techniques, but is capable of being danced to way faster songs.
                    It is a cardio workout, includes lots of core work, and thus, you are going to sweat a lot (bring addition shirts).
                    At the same time, you can also dance it very efficiently, by kicking and stepping smaller.<br/>
                    PS: Check out this <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/78dBYR3ro1G7COwKpaN4Tr">playlist on spotify</a> from our dear teacher Lucia.
                </p>

                <h3 id="Basics_Charleston_Steps">Steps</h3>
                <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
                <p>
                    Always keep your upper body <b>bent</b> forward, hinge from pelvis, and still your chest straight upright; there is lots of core work there. The <b>connection</b> is really important, not only to convey intention, but also to keep synchronized with the bounce and movement: The leader having her tight around the waist, the follower push slightly with the arm down (no gap).<br/>
                    There are many <b>styling</b> possibilities, like throwing your arms, the direction of the kicks, rotation of the pelvis, and movements of the upper body. At least keep your arms moving as you do while walking, and don't keep the hanging like dead fish.
                    Especially when you dance solo, feel free to decorate and express even more (taking more space, throwing more).
                    When dancing with a partner, watch out not to kick him, or other people when there is little space around you, are doing a close-proximity technique like the <i>Tandem</i> move.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always begin by <b>pulsing</b> (instead of big bouncing) and syncing with your partner, getting sure whether you both are hearing the same music.
                    As with Lindy, the leader starts with <b>left leg</b>, the follower with her right.
                    Also, keeping the pulse throughout will make things much easier, as the body goes in some sort of autopilot.
                    Keep on hopping with every kick, every hold and every step.

                    We first have a look at the <b>8-count</b> basic (as with Lindy, there also exists a 6-count).
                    The <b>pattern</b> is as follows: rock step (1+2) - kick step (3+4) - kick (5) - hold (6) - kick back (7) - step (8)<br/>
                    The kick is not really a kick, but more a release/drop after bending the knee, and thus is rather relaxed.
                    This kick is also really done on one leg kick, with a short midair moment of both feet, and then step; it takes more dynamic/explosive energy, so don't get too lazy ;)

                    Some advice on how to dance Charleston a bit more energy efficient:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make smaller steps.</li>
                    <li>Lean your upper body forward.</li>
                    <li>Keep your feet on the ground while kicking.</li>
                    <li>Only release from the knee, instead of a full-blown kick motion.</li>
                </ul>

                    This technique is usually called hand-to-hand (or is the open doors the regular facing into the same, and the hand-to-hand where facing opposite directions?), which has two versions: One where both are facing the same, or the other direction.
                    The basic footwork consists of: kick - hold/turn - kick - step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To enter the move, you need to simply turn on the hold-step (2nd kick to the front), and indicate clearly to the follower by creating a bit more distance, change your body posture, but most importantly, move the hand on the closer side of the body.<br/>
                    The other version is entered by the leader staying in the same direction for one kick (doing a simple <i>repeater</i>) and from there only an arm/hand/wrist stretch while keeping the turns alive.

                    A variation (or a little spice to add) would be to turn 540 degrees (one-and-a-half turn) and then find each other's hands again. See the second video below for a demonstration of how that could look like.

* One of the (three big) representants of *Pragmatism*
** "True is, what works".
** When two equally possible explanations (e.g. does god exist or not?) exist, which can't be proven right or wrong, then choose based on the effect.
** The "big streams": Pragmatism (whatever turns out to be useful), rationalism (sit in your room think it through) and empirism (experience by senses, go out in the world and see for yourself).

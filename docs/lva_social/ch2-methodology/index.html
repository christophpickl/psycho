<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">Not necessarily. It seems obvious due to the distraction, but others factors might play a role: Students studying less, are simply more interested in social media. Also, students with photographic skills might be less skilled in academic subjects.</span></p>

<p>There are more learning <strong>disabilities</strong> in <strong>private schools</strong>. Does the teaching in those schools cause these disabilities?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">Not necessarily. A third factor, the presence of school psychologists who notice and diagnose the disability, could be the actual cause. In fact, the number can be equal, just it&#8217;s less likely to be identified in private schools.</span></p>

<p>There is a negative correlation between <strong>Eastern religions</strong> that favor vegetarianism and <strong>heart attacks</strong>. Can converting to those religions reduce getting a heart attack?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">Not necessarily, but switching to vegetarianism definitely reduces heart attacks. Other factors could explain the relationship, like stress reduction due to meditation and outlooks on life.</span></p>

<p>There is a negative correlation between increasing <strong>temperatures</strong> and number of <strong>pirates</strong>. Can we reverse climate change by adding more pirates to the sea?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">No, just a random convergence in math. Sociopolitical factors were at hand: Due to the industrial revolution, pirates decreased, while higher population and lifestyle changes happened at the same period.</span></p>

<li>
<p>Many school <strong>shooting</strong> were done by students who played a specific <strong>shooter</strong>. Should we ban that game to prevent murders?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">Possibly. Also likely that it is the other way round though. Also it&#8217;s not about a particular game, also consider other media like TV.</span></p>

<li>
<p>People who are more <strong>intelligent</strong> <strong>swear</strong> more and have <strong>messier</strong> desks. Can you increase your intelligent by being like this as well?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">Probably not; people who are more intelligent have a larger vocabulary; people who swear more, have a bigger vocabulary. ALso, more intelligent people focus on work rather cleaning up their desks.</span></p>

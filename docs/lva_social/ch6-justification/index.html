<p>So what is <strong>cognitive dissonance</strong>, and how do we avoid it to maintain a positive self-image?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we saw in <a href="../ch1-introduction/index.html">chapter 1</a>, self-esteem is our evaluation of our self-worth (we view ourselves as good/competent/decent).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we saw in the previous <a href="../ch5-self/index.html">chapter 5</a>, the function of the self is to maintain our self-esteem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems that the biggest determinant of our behavior is the motivation to preserve a stable, positive self-image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../../people/festinger-leon.html">Leon Festinger</a> developed the most provocative theory in psychology: The theory of cognitive dissonance.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Or how Festinger defined it: The discomfort that is caused when two cognitions conflict, or when our behavior conflicts with our attitudes.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This definition was revised by his student Elliot Aronson: Dissonance is most painful (and most motivated to be reduced) when dissonant cognitions challenge our self-esteem (sense of self-worth).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can it be reduced then?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Changing behavior (align it with the dissonant cognition)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing a dissonant cognition (to justify our behavior)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding new cognitions (also to justify our behavior)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take <strong>smoking</strong> for example:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Imagine you tried, and failed in the past. You might feel bad about yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To reduce dissonance, change one of your dissonant cognitions: belief that smoking is harmful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So now you are free to continue smoking without feeling terrible about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applying the three strategies above to reduce dissonance and be happy again:</p>
<div class="olist lowerroman">
<ol class="lowerroman" type="i">
<li>
<p>Stop smoking (change behavior)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change cognitions (smoking isn&#8217;t bad)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add consonant cognition (smoking is relaxing)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Young people tend to justify this by saying things like "smoking is cool", "I want to be like my friends", "in movies, everyone smokes", "I&#8217;m healthy; nothing is going to happen to e", "adults are always on my back about stuff I do", or "who wants to be 90 anyway".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes people say that it&#8217;s worth the risk, it&#8217;s enjoyable, it relaxes them and reduces nervous tension and therefor actually improves their health.</p>

<p>Human thinking is not rational, but rationalizing.</p>

<p>No matter how smart you are: You will behave irrationally and maladaptively.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When we choose one option, the chosen one is never entirely positive, and the rejected alternative never entirely negative.</p>

<p>It works because:</p>

<ul>

<p>This will lead to a significant amount of dissonance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might want to convince yourself how nicer, more interesting/worthwhile the club/people are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doing so is possible because activities/behaviors are open to a wide range of possible interpretations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If being motivated (reduction of dissonance), we tend to interpret these ambiguities in a positive way.</p>

<p>And the more effort we put it, the more we will like it; even (especially!) if it&#8217;s something we don&#8217;t actually like.</p>

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A severe threat would create an external justification for not doing it.</p>

<p>E.g. your child asks himself "Why didn&#8217;t I beat up my little brother?"</p>

<p>There is no convincing answer, as the punishment is so mild, it doesn&#8217;t provide a superabundance of justification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The justification for refraining from beating his brother up is not strong enough to explain his compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The child must find another way to justify his compliance: By substituting the external with an <strong>internal</strong> justification:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reducing dissonance by convincing himself he doesn&#8217;t want to beat him up; maybe even decide beating up other kids is not fun.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>They were less likely to play with it (than a group with a more severe punishment) as their own, internal justification led to devaluing the attractiveness of the toy (effectively reducing dissonance).</p>

<p>"I didn&#8217;t want to play with it anyhow."</p>

<p>"<em>Dissonance in close relationships</em>"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dissonance arises in interpersonal relationships as well, when we compare our own accomplishments with others'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E.g. you think you are a good soccer player.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You move to another town, and your new best friend is a professional soccer player. How does that make you feel?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>*Maybe a bit uneasy that he outdoes you in "your area" of expertise?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now instead that he is a pro soccer player, he is a very talented painter. Do you feel anyhow uncomfortable?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Probably not. Most likely you even take pleasure in your friend&#8217;s success.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will feel dissonance in relationship under three conditions:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>We feel close to that person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is outperforming us in a particular area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That area is central to our self-esteem.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, dissonance only occurs when a friend is better at a task which is important to us as we define ourselves with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To reduce that dissonance (which threatens our self-esteem), we can do three things:</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Distance ourselves from that person (not a close friend anymore; not wanting to work with him anymore).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconsidering how important that activity is to our self-esteem (losing interest in soccer; not important to us anymore).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Become even better at that activity; but if your friend is still better, you might go down a diabolic route: undermine (sabotage) his performance, so you are superior.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Does that mean that we are evil beings, trying to sabotage our friends to feel better?</p>

<li>
<p>Definitely not always, but when our self-esteem is at stake, we may not be as helpful as we would like to think.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the task is not important to us, we are easy going supporting our friends, wishing them the best.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the task is high in self-relevance though, e.g. the game/test is highly correlated with intelligence or leadership skills, people gave <em>harder</em> clues to their friends than to strangers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It feels threatening to our self-esteem, if friends outperform us, so we make sure they do not.</p>

<p>In 2013 during the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, someone was beaten by the police, causing great unrest among the people. The protesters were unarmed and subdued, still the police officers attacked them. How would the judicial system have had reduced the dissonance arising from conflicting assertions of "We are morally responsible people," and "We beat up an already subdued protester who was pinned to the ground"?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They did so by adding a new cognition. We did it for the stability of Hong Kong, to teach them a lesson to conform to rules and authorities. The officers got only suspended from duty and denied doing any grievous bodily harm.</p>

<p>This kind of power abuse happens often all over the world. These people don&#8217;t believe they are doing intentionally malevolent things, as they are deceiving themselves.

<p>Not everyone is extremely self-focused of course, we still like to help others.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>As a matter of fact, helping others (through volunteer work) makes ourselves happier (more effective than the narcissistic route).</p>
</li>

<p>Imagine receiving an envelope with 20 euros in it; those who spent it on others are happier than those who spent it on themselves.</p>

<p>To sum up:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Having high self-esteem is a good thing, as it makes us optimistic about the future and work harder.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If it gets too much (along lack of empathy), narcissism arises.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Best is to feel good about ourselves, and still be able to learn from our mistakes, and to care about others.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The self&#8217;s function is to protect/maintain our <strong>self-esteem</strong>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Self-esteem being: how we evaluate our self-worth, seeing ourselves as good, competent, and decent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dissonance arises when our self-esteem is threatened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce it by changing behavior, justifying our behavior by changing dissonant cognition or adding a new one.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decisions</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>After deciding, there will be dissonance, as we choose for one and implicitly not for the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post-decision dissonance</strong>: The discomfort experienced that we may have made the wrong choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the decision is final, we "solidify" it; the more permanent/irrevocable, the stronger the need to reduce dissonance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lowballing</strong>: A salesperson strategy offering a low price at first, the claiming it being an error, and subsequently raising the price.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification of Effort</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>We like things more when they were hard to get. Think of loyalty for fraternities and military ("initiation rituals").</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Counter-attitudinal Behavior</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When we act counter our private belief/attitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big external justification (large reward), no dissonance, no attitude change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reward small, we resort to internal justification; reduction of dissonance by changing attitude/behavior.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Much more powerful effect on our long-term values/behaviors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good against: prejudices, self-defeating beliefs, harmful practices like bulimia.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benjamin Franklin effect: Ask someone for a little favour, internal justification will make them like you more, as they did something nice to you.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Other way round as well: When you did something bad, make your victims less worth, deserved it, none of your people, less than human (during war).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoiding Temptations</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change people by giving them mild threats ("insufficient punishment") not to do something.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dissonance due to not enough external justification for having resisted a desired activity/object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The less severe the punishment/smaller the reward, the more internal justification necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hypocrisy Paradigm</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>By hypocrisy induction, confronting people the difference between what they say and what they do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The need to reduce dissonance can lead to behavioral change (condoms for AIDS-prevention).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dissonance across <strong>cultures</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It occurs cross-culturally, but the content differs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As well as the process and the intensity of dissonance reduction do vary (due to differences in cultural norms).</p>

<h3 id="_advances_and_extensions_of_cognitive_dissonance_theory">Advances and extensions of cognitive dissonance theory</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Affirmation Theory</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reducing dissonance by focusing on an unrelated domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The values affirmation writing exercise (write why a value is important to you) shows lasting positive effects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Evaluation Maintenance Theory</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Conditions: When a close friend (1) outperforms us(2) in an area central to our self-esteem (3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strategies: Dissonance reduction by stop friendship (1), doing better (2), not that important to us (3); in extreme cases: sabotage.</p>

<h3 id="_overcoming_dissonance_and_proscons_of_high_self_esteem">Overcoming dissonance and pros/cons of high self-esteem</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reducing dissonance to maintain our self-esteem is ok.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>But if we do it all the time, defending our egos, we would never learn from mistake/bad decisions/incorrect beliefs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overcoming it</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dissonance reduction becomes counterproductive when it solidifies negative values/behaviors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By awareness; consciously pause the self-justification process to reflect on our action.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Narcissism</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A high self-esteem protects from depression, persevere in the face of failure, and protects us from thoughts about our own mortality (terror management theory).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But extreme high self-esteem, combined with lack of empathy, leads to narcissism (with all its consequences).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best combination: Feel good about yourself, but also care about others.</p>

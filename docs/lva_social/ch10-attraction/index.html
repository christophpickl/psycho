<p><strong>Young People&#8217;s Hook-up Culture</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today&#8217;s teenagers have an unprecedented level of casual, quick, and commitment-free sexual encounters with regularly rotating number of new partners, which stands in stark contrast to more traditional ideas of courtship, dating, and relationships of the past.
It sounds compelling, but is it true? Recent research suggests that this may be more a myth than reality. Let&#8217;s start with the term "hook-up": One-half had genitals involved, and one-fourth sexual intercourse. Half hook-ups was with a familiar, repeat partner. So they are not at all those one-time sex with first-time partners we might think.
Some US survey indicated that in the 90s about 49% of young adults had two or fewer sex partners since the age of 18. Around 2010 that rate stayed unchanged at around 51%.
The idea around a hook-up culture illustrates how expectations and common sense assumptions about human sexuality do not always align with scientific data and real behavior.</p>

<p>We like to be liked -fullstop.</p>

<p>Knowing that a person likes us, fuels our attraction to that person.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Liking can even make up for the absence of similarity, so powerful is it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Men would show liking towards a woman expressing interest (eye contact, leaning forward, listening attentively), although they knew she disagreed on important issues with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether there are verbal or non-verbal clues, the most crucial determinant of whether we like a person is to which we <em>believe</em> that person likes us.</p>

<li>
<p>Pretty faces are like magnets: We like to look longer at them. But:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>That bias to stare a bit longer at attractive faces can be broken with love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participants in an experiment were asked to imagine a crush would also have feelings for them. This would disrupt our otherwise default focus (on alternatives out there).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If our attention was constantly hijacked by <em>every</em> pretty face, we could never turn initial interactions into meaningful ones, and sustained romantic relationships.</p>
</li>

<p>With the glow of reciprocated liking, we stop having a wandering eye, at least for a while, convincing us that the grass may not be greener on the other side.</p>

<p>Simply put, the Halo effect is about: "What is beautiful, is good".</p>

<p>Physical attractiveness has its largest effect in relation to social competence: Beautiful people are thought to be more sociable, extroverted, assertive, sexual, and popular.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Interestingly, there is some empirical support for that: Highly attractive people <em>do</em> actually develop good social interaction skills.</p>

<p>Evolutionary psychology makes some interesting (and controversial) predictions regarding sex differences in mate preference, based on the investment theory:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For females, reproduction is costly (time, energy, effort), plus the discomfort/risk of pregnancy, and upbringing until maturity.</p>
<div class="ulist">

<p>It&#8217;s serious business for them, so they have to consider carefully when and with whom to reproduce.</p>

<p>Throughout the world, male&#8217;s reproductive success is measured by offspring <em>quantity</em>.</p>
<div class="ulist">

<p>Female&#8217;s success lies in successfully raising each offspring to maturity; thus they pair less often and only with carefully chosen males, because of the high costs.</p>

<li>
<p>We find attractive based on external cues in the opposite sex.</p>

<p>One could argue that the advantages of having multiple sex partners should also apply to women.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It increases the odds of getting resources for the offspring, and benefits the genetic diversity.</p>

<li>
<p>Women could choose one guy for "good genes" and the other to raise the offspring.</p>

<p>One could argue men value physical attractiveness not because of evolved tendencies, but because being taught by society.</p>
<div class="ulist">

<li>
<p>Men have been conditioned by decades of advertising, media images and other cultural messages to prioritize beauty.</p>

<li>
<p>Also conditioned to have a more recreational approach to sex (than women do).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some research has found that women value physical attractiveness just as much as men; especial considering a potential sexual partner (opposed to a marriage partner).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Around the world, women have less power, status, wealth and other resources; thus they rely on men for economic security.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>The more economic power women have in a culture, the more highly they prioritize a man&#8217;s physical attractiveness.</p>

<li>
<p>It is very difficult to disentangle "nature" (inborn preferences) from "nurture" (cultural norms and gender roles).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether looking at online dating, speed-dating, &#8230;&#8203; women are significantly more discriminating.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reason being, that women have to be picky, is because their fertility window is relatively narrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet, when tweaking speed dating, that men staid seated, and women had to rotate, to approach, women were not pickier than men anymore.</p>

<p>Tips about deceptive profiles:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use of fewer first-person pronouns ("I" and "me"); those who lie distance themselves psychologically from their half-truths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of negations/negative turns of phrase ("not judgmental" instead of "open-minded", "not averse to taking risks" instead of "adventurous").</p>

<p>The process and experience of it.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Divorces happen often after 3-4 years (research from Dr. Helen Fisher tells us in: "Anatomy of love").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breaking up is one of life&#8217;s most painful experiences; thus we develop different disengagement strategies.</p>

<p>Relationship dissolution is not a single event, but a process with 4 steps (see list below).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Intrapersonal: We think a lot about our relationship dissatisfaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dyadic: Discussing the breakup with the partner.</p>

<p>Social: Announcing breaking to others.</p>

<p>Why do relationships end? Four types of behavior (two destructive/constructive behaviors):</p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>Actively harming (abuse, threat)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passively allow deterioration (avoidance, ignorance, no effort)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actively trying to improve (talk, change, seek support)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passively remaining loyal</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 30% of the cases, the things we liked initially most about our partner, will be the very reason we break up.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Statements like: "He is so unusual and different" becomes "He and I have nothing in common". Or "She is so exciting and unpredictable" becomes "I can never count on her".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This should remind us of the importance <strong>similarities</strong> in relationships.</p>

</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Men and women end romantic relationships same amount of time -not true what some might believe that women break up more often.</p>

<p>All relationships experience conflicts, not all deal with it the same (un/healthy) way.</p>

<p>Better chances with:</p>

<p>Remaining friends afterward is more likely with higher rates of satisfaction and investment.</p>

<p>Sometimes it can be stressful if people keep track of their exes activities/new partners. Better to totally disconnect then, to get some peace back.</p>

<p>Three main themes for women&#8217;s emotional reaction after a break-up: 1) shame/guilt 2) failure 3) isolation and loneliness.</p>

<h3 id="_versus_philosophy_science_and_common_sense">Versus philosophy, science and common sense</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Philosophy</strong> is the origin of contemporary psychology.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It gave insights about the nature of <strong>consciousness</strong>, and how people form <strong>beliefs</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychology deals with the same questions, but more <strong>scientifically</strong>:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using <strong>empirical</strong> questions: Answers derived from experimentation/measurement rather personal opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could of course also simply <strong>ask people</strong>, but most often they are <strong>unaware</strong> of the underlying reasons behind their responses and feelings. Those justifications might not be the real reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can also use <strong>common sense</strong> or folk wisdom, yet, they often <strong>disagree</strong> with one another.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example "<em>birds of a feather flock together</em>" (or "<em>same stays with same</em>") and on the other hand folk wisdom states "<em>opposites attract</em>".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another example would be "<em>out of sight is out of mind</em>" versus "<em>absence makes the heart grow fonder</em>".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are certain <strong>conditions</strong> where one or the other statement might be true.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social psychologists use scientific methods to test assumptions/guesses/ideas in a empirically/systematically way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take for example when a suicide bomber attacks, the popular story says that he must be mentally ill, alienated loner, or a psychopath. As a social psychologist, we would try to understand the circumstances of this otherwise healthy, well-educated, bright person who did that for sake of a religious/political goal.</p>

<h3 id="_how_it_differs_from_its_cousins">How it differs from its cousins</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cousins like: biology, neuroscience, sociology, economics and political science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of them examine the determinants of human behavior, but on a different <strong>level of analysis</strong>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>E.g. neuroscientists operate on the level of genes and hormones, and biologists explain long necks of giraffes based on evolution theory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social behavior has also <strong>genetic determinants</strong>, which evolve through <strong>natural selection</strong>, leading to <strong>evolutionary psychology</strong>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Evolution occurs veeery slowly though, thus is our behavior partly result of adaptations to environments in our distant past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a lively debate about the <strong>testability</strong> of evolutionary hypotheses, as it relies on best guesses and can&#8217;t be tested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E.g. Have giraffes long necks because it was an advantage in fights? This is impossible to test directly&#8230;&#8203;</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>In <strong>personality psychology</strong> we focus more on traits of people, their <strong>individual differences</strong>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For personality and clinical psychologists, the level of analysis is the individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its disadvantage is that it ignores the powerful role of social influence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example, what is a person "really" like?! Arrogant or charming, shy or extroverted? It&#8217;s the wrong question, as he is both and neither, depending on the situation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>For social psychologists, the level of analysis is the person&#8217;s construal of the situation (shaped by social context).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example, why do we hurt others? Look at the how he construes a specific situation: Does he feel frustrated? Was there aggression preceded? What are the conditions he would vent his frustration or restrain himself?</p>

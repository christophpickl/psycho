<p><strong>Philosophy</strong> is the origin of contemporary psychology.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It gave insights about the nature of <strong>consciousness</strong>, and how people form <strong>beliefs</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychology deals with the same questions, but more <strong>scientifically</strong>:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using <strong>empirical</strong> questions: Answers derived from experimentation/measurement rather personal opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could of course also simply <strong>ask people</strong>, but most often they are <strong>unaware</strong> of the underlying reasons behind their responses and feelings. Those justifications might not be the real reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can also use <strong>common sense</strong> or folk wisdom, yet, they often <strong>disagree</strong> with one another.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example "<em>birds of a feather flock together</em>" (or "<em>same stays with same</em>") and on the other hand folk wisdom states "<em>opposites attract</em>".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another example would be "<em>out of sight is out of mind</em>" versus "<em>absence makes the heart grow fonder</em>".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are certain <strong>conditions</strong> where one or the other statement might be true.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Social psychologists use scientific methods to test assumptions/guesses/ideas in a empirically/systematically way.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Take for example when a suicide bomber attacks, the popular story says that he must be mentally ill, alienated loner, or a psychopath.

<p>Cousins like: biology, neuroscience, sociology, economics and political science.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>E.g. neuroscientists operate on the level of genes and hormones, and biologists explain long necks of giraffes based on evolution theory.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<li>
<p>Social behavior has also <strong>genetic determinants</strong>, which evolve through <strong>natural selection</strong>, leading to <strong>evolutionary psychology</strong>.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Evolution occurs veeery slowly though, thus is our behavior partly result of adaptations to environments in our distant past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a lively debate about the <strong>testability</strong> of evolutionary hypotheses, as it relies on best guesses and can&#8217;t be tested.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For personality and clinical psychologists, the level of analysis is the individual.</p>

<p>Its disadvantage is that it ignores the powerful role of social influence.</p>

<p>For example, what is a person "really" like?! Arrogant or charming, shy or extroverted? It&#8217;s the wrong question, as he is both and neither, depending on the situation.</p>

<li>
<p>We sometimes bend reality, but usually don&#8217;t completely break it, as we are skilled in social cognition.</p>

<li>
<p>We still use mental short-cuts to make judgements.</p>
<div class="ulist">

<p>We are not perfect in understanding/predicting, as we never know all the facts to judge accurately.</p>

<div class="ulist">

<p>If you choose the "healthier looking" package, then you stepped in a cognitive trap: You generalized from the cover to the product, instead checking the ingredients table.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social psychology is the study of <strong>social influence</strong>, but why do we want to do that anyway? Because out of <strong>curiosity</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social media is a social psychologist&#8217;s dream laboratory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To contribute to the solution of social problems:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Kurt Lewin escaped Nazi Germany, and wanted to understand the transformation of his country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To reduce violence and prejudice; to increase altruism and tolerance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To induce people to conserve resources, practice safe sex, and eat healthier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study effects of violence in media; find effective strategies to resolve conflicts; find ways to raise children&#8217;s intelligence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>But also to study happier topics, like: passion, liking, love, and what sustains them.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Change your self-defeating/misguided behavior, improve relationships, and make better decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask the right questions; study the social world in detail; find truths which are (close to being) universal.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Define</strong> social psychology and how it <strong>differs</strong> from other disciplines.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scientific study of how our feeling/thoughts/behaviors are influenced by others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using empirical methods, to discover universal laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to evolutionary psychology, taking genetic factors into account (hard to test experimentally).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personality psychologists focus on individual character traits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indeed personalities are different, but social psychologists focus on the power of the situation. The level of analysis is on the individual within the context of a social situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sociology focuses on society at large (groups, institutions).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>What&#8217;s the importance of how we <strong>explain/interpret</strong> events/ourselves?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Never underestimate the power of the situation. Our behavior is influenced by our social environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fundamental attribution error: overestimate behavior based on personality traits, underestimate social influence. Situations are more powerful than we usually would think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A two-way street: People perceive/interpret the social world; we use construals: the world as it is interpreted by us.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens when the need to <strong>feel good</strong> about yourself and being <strong>accurate</strong> conflict?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Human motives: we want to feel good about ourselves (self-esteem) and be accurate (social cognition) at the same time; which sometimes conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-esteem: We want to see ourselves as good, competent, decent. For that to preserve we need to distort our perception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social cognition: We need accurate understandings to make effective judgements. We usually act on incomplete/inaccurate interpreted information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the study of social psychology <strong>important</strong>?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simply to follow our curiosity and fascination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To solve social problems.</p>

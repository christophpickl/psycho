</li>
<li>
<p>Get (hunt/grow) more food, find mates, and care for children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Across all cultures, we form relationships, monitor their status in groups, and remain vigilant if they might get rejected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, the need to feel distinctive from those who do <em>not</em> belong to the same groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Especially small groups can give us both: sense of belonging and making us feel special (clubs, art organizations).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Important part of our (social) identity; helping us define who we are.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>People are a good source of information to resolve ambiguity.</p>

<div class="ulist">

<p>When the roles are clearly defined, we are satisfied and perform well.</p>

<li>
<p>In extreme cases, we lose our personalities if getting too far into a role.</p>

<p>A group&#8217;s composition is also defined by its diversity: age, sex, beliefs, and opinions.</p>

<li>
<p>Two reasons for the homogeneity of groups:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Similarity attracts ("birds of a feather flock together" as in the English proverb).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Groups tend to operate in ways that encourage similarity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>We tend to gravitate toward groups with similar others, and such similarity predicts group cohesiveness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Homogeneous groups are often cohesive, thus they like their fellow group members more if all the same, than if members are diverse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cohesive doesn&#8217;t mean it is performing at its optimal level though!</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Diverse groups (race, experience, education, attitude) can come up with more feasible and effective possibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diversity can come at the expense of cohesiveness and morale, yet leads to improved creativity, information sharing, and flexible problem-solving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The friction caused by diversity can upend conformity and improve decision-making.</p>

<p>People try to manipulate us, so we do what they want us to do (to conform to their influence).</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Western culture (esp. American) is individualistic, think for yourself, and non-conforming.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This cultural self-image was shaped by the historical experience with western expansion (Wild West taming).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think for example of the "Marlboro Man", the most successful advertising campaign in American history.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>We obviously like to think of ourselves not of spineless, weak conformists, but that we make up our own minds.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Remember Apple&#8217;s advertisement slogan "Think different".</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conforming to an extreme leads to mass suicide; see <a href="../ch6-justification/index.html">chapter 6 - justification</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seemingly ordinary people, when put under social pressure, conform to a surprising degree.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take for example the American civil rights movement from 1961.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They followed Gandhi&#8217;s principles of nonviolent protest to end segregation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A form of passive acceptance of violent treatment; remaining calm in the face of harassment (threats, insult, violence).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New recruits conformed leading to a contagious commitment to nonviolent protest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social pressure can of course also result in a less heroic (and more immoral) behavior:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>About 500 Vietnamese civilians died when other soldiers joined in the shooting of villagers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The abuse of Iraqi captivates at the Abu Ghraib prison in 2003.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>American soldiers urinating on the corpses of Taliban fighters in 2011.</p>

<p>A study created an ambiguous task: eyewitness identification.</p>

<p>The participants had to pick a "perpetrator"; but doing it several times.</p>

<p>The picture of the perpetrator was shown only half a second (to make it difficult and ambiguous).</p>

<p>Afterward, they had to pick the right one out of a list of four men.</p>

<li>
<p>In the second phase, they were put in a group (with three confederates) which gave, before him, the wrong answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an A) low-importance condition, people conformed 35% and B) high-importance 50% to the group&#8217;s judgement.</p>

<p>Thus: Informational social influence for eyewitness is a bad thing to uncover the truth.</p>

<p>Answer: yes! They gave 12 out of 18 times the wrong answer to conform. 76% conformed to the wrong answer at least once. On average one third.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When we want to become members of a group, and experience an initial, embarrassing/degrading act, how can we now say no to the next request?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We become the "puppet", we are not responsible, as "it was their idea", and we were "simply following orders".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loss of a sense of personal responsibility is a critical component in obedience.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>We offload personal responsibility to someone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E.g. a prison guard executing a death sentence, reducing his cognitive dissonance (immoral act of killing vs. obeying the law) by engaging in self-justification.</p>

<p>Milgram&#8217;s work was done in the 1960s and was replicated in 11 countries, involving about 3,000 participants.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yet, it ignited a lot of protest (and soul-searching) about the ethical treatment of those participants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasons being:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The use of deception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that there was no fully informed consent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The use of psychological distress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No clarity about the right to withdraw (the opposite was the case, by saying "you have to continue").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience of inflicted insight after the study (people learned unpleasant things about themselves they had not agreed to beforehand).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improper debriefing, as some participants were unaware about the confederates, and that the shocks had been fake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of formalized ethical guidelines established in the meantime, it got increasingly challenging to reproduce obedience research.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Such studies as Milgram did them could never be run again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet, they were reproduced ethically and found no significant different in obedience rates between then and now.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Poland study showed that 90% of their participants were obedient; similar to Milgram&#8217;s 82.5% finding who went up to 150-volt.</p>

<p>Science has sometimes two competing aims: to discover new knowledge and to do no harm.</p>

<li>
<p>Occurs when we don&#8217;t know the correct/best action to take.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We look at the behavior of others as a source of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually results in <em>private acceptance</em> (we genuinely believe in what others are doing/saying).</p>

<li>
<p>When we want to be <strong>accurate</strong>, we are more likely to conform through informational social influence.</p>

<p>We are more likely to conform in an <strong>ambiguous</strong> situation, in a <strong>crisis</strong> or if <strong>experts</strong> are present.</p>

<p>When being <strong>accurate</strong> is that important, that we resist normative social influence (go against the group).</p>

<p>Consequences of <strong>resisting</strong>: Ridicule, ostracism, and rejection by the group.</p>

<p>When to conform: According to <em>social impact theory</em>, depending on strength/immediacy/size of the group.</p>
<div class="ulist">

<p>How we can use the knowledge of social influence. Conformity tactics:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Communicating <em>injunctive norms</em> (expectation what&#8217;s approved behavior) more powerful than <em>descriptive norms</em> (expectation what&#8217;s actual behavior).</p>

<p>Boomerang effect: Make undesirable behavior more likely than it was.</p>

<p>Marketing strategies:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Foot-in-the-door technique</em>: First small request, then bigger (more likely to say yes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Door-in-the-face technique</em>: First large request, rejected, then small request (negotiating, reciprocity).</p>

<p>When someone gets a placebo treatment and others' feelings/perceptions about that treatment influence their judgments about its effectiveness.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A positive effect of a patient&#8217;s treatment on persons in their surrounding (such as family members or healthcare providers), who feel better because the patient is being treated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even visible in pets like dogs, cats, horses, and rats: These animals feel better after receiving a placebo/fake-treatment.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Possible explanation: The owner trusts in the (not knowing) placebo and gets more relaxed, which has in turn a positive effect on the animal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proxy can also feel worse when a patient is treated, which then is called the "nocebo (effect) by proxy".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Placebo effect: The biopsychosocial process, which engages perceptual/cognitive processes that lead to therapeutic benefits associated with the administration of a placebo in the context of individuals being treated.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In contrast, the placebo effect needs to be distinguished from the placebo response, which includes all health outcomes that follow administration of an inactive treatment.</p>

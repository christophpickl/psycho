<div class="title">Definition</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When attractive people get better treated because we think of them as better (intelligence, social competence, morality).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A.k.a. "Physical attractiveness stereotype", or "physical attractiveness stereotype", or "beautiful-is-good stereotype", or "attractiveness halo".</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attractive = symmetry, averageness, health and fertility.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attractive bias: successful, dominant, sociable, trustworthy, mentally stable, intelligent, &#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>For women: socially acknowledged features of sexuality (makeup, lipstick) and a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.70 (as seen in all advertisements; opposed to men&#8217;s 0.90).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stereotypical feminine characteristics: thick mouth and upper lip, smaller lower faces, and prominent cheekbones.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>For men: wealth and power (social status, high-paying job); expensive clothes, automobiles.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stereotypical masculine characteristics: broad jaw, pronounced brow ridge, and a wide nose and chin.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to be perceived more intelligent (independent of attractiveness): enough sleep (eyelid openness!), (subtle) smile, grooming</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although we say to "not judge a book by its cover", we still do, and simply can&#8217;t help it.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You may find it an unethical thing to do, yet you do it unconsciously and can&#8217;t be blamed for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even toddlers look longer on attractive faces (independent of age, race, or gender).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is known to be a cross-cultural phenomena.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facial cues guide our first impressions, thus also our decisions.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some facial cues are actually valid indicators for things such as health or intelligence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pretty-privilege (social, economical, political): Attractive children get more affection from their mother, adults get more attention from the opposite sex, better job success, receive more leniency in court, &#8230;&#8203;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disadvantage though if same-sex people have to judge a pretty person (removing potential "mating threat").</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experiment: application form (with picture, name, address) left in a phone booth.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only difference was the picture: attractive or not, male or female, white or black.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As expected, the forms with the attractive pictures were more often returned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conclusion: If you are ugly, you are at a disadvantage.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>But you can work out, dress nicely, and accumulate wealth and social status to stand a fighting chance in getting preferential treatment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Related to the expectancy effect: the more expected, the better perform (self-fulfilling prophecy; pigmeleon effect = told students were intelligent, and became so)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also see the related <a href="halo_effect.html">halo effect</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gender bias is a subset of this bias, influencing your likelihood of getting a certain (male/female) job just because of your gender (perceived masculine/feminine characteristics).</p>
</li>

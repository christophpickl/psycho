<div class="title">Figure 1. The cards used for the conformity experiment, showing on the left the reference line, and on the right one of three lines to choose from which is equal to the reference line.</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Look at the image above: You might think immediately that the answer is obvious, and when anyone who would be asked, would say C, but that&#8217;s not so under all circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="../people/asch-solomon.html">Solomon Asch</a> conducted 1951 an experiment which showed that peer pressure can be strong enough to change our perception, and make us believe things that are not true.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each participant was sent into a room with a few other people which were actually confederates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The whole group was shown two cards, similar as the one above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each person should then say out loud the answer, the real participant coming last.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a while, the group started to give wrong answers, leaving a choice of either going against the group, or against the truth.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>All in order to avoid the discomfort of disagreeing with the group.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The result: 23% always gave the wrong answer, 72% conformed at least once, and 5% completely succumbed to peer pressure.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yet, if there is only a single person giving the right answer, participants are way more likely to stay with the truth (having an allied).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long story short: If 3 people say something obviously wrong, and no one disagrees with them, most of us will agree with the wrong statement, as we need to fit in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s especially having an effect among women and homogenous peer groups.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question remains: How strong is this conformity effect on social media?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two different types of conformity:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Informational: Agreeing with the group because they convinced us that they are right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Normative: Agreeing with the group because we are afraid that they will disapprove of us being deviant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, having to write down the answer (instead speaking out publicly) drastically decreases the pressure to conform.</p>
</li>
</ul>

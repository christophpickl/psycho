<p>Moving the goalposts (or making up an exception) when the claim was shown to be false.</p>

<li>
<p>An informal fallacy which is the application of a double standard (implying that two things which are the same are measured by different standards).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You state that something is an exception to a general/universal principle, without justifying the special exception.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>Humans are funny creatures and have a foolish aversion to being wrong.</p>
<div class="ulist">

<p>Rather than appreciate the benefits of being able to change one&#8217;s mind through better understanding, many will invent ways to cling to old beliefs.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s usually very easy to find a reason to believe something that suits us, and it requires integrity and genuine honesty with oneself to examine one&#8217;s own beliefs and motivations without falling into the trap of justifying our existing ways of seeing ourselves and the world around us.</p>

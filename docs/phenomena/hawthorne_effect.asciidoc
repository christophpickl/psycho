* In the 1930s at the Hawthorne Plant of Western Electric in Illinois, researches wanted to investigate productivity.
** Unfortunately, no matter what they did (better lighting, regular breaks, etc.), it almost always (initially) improved.
** Not due to the changes, but due to the *experiment itself*.
** The subjects knew they were *observed* / receiving special treatment.
* How to *counteract*?
Make use of *habituation*:
** Subjects get used to the presence of researchers, thus have no impact anymore.

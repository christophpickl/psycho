<ul>
<li>
<p>Philip Zimbardo paid students to play the role of guards or prisoners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plan was to observe them for 2 weeks, to see whether they will act like real prison guards/prisoners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They actually indeed quickly assumed these roles, which made them end the experiment after only 6 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reason being: Most guards became abusive, verbally harassing and humiliating the prisoners.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The prisoners became passive, helpless, and withdrawn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some prisoners had to be released earlier because they became so anxious and depressed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>This all happened although everyone knew it was a psychology experiment.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This simple truth was overlooked, the make-believe was so compelling and powerful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>People&#8217;s personal identities and sense of decency got lost.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lots of criticism, not only obvious ethical questions, but also how the study was done.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rumors say the researches influenced the participants, e.g. telling the guards exactly what they need to do/say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Participants also knew what the study was about, and role-played in a manner they thought was expected of them.</p>

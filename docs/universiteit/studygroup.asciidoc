= My Ideas/Wishes

NOTE:  repetition, continuity, personal, motivation, pressure

* *meet regularly*; either online or real (in Amsterdam)
* set *dates and deadlines* in order to create "artificial pressure"
** so we don't end up doing everything at the end, but continuously progress
* *actively* process the information
** *present* content to each other; maybe with predefined topics with a real presentation
*** randomly one gets picked, so everyone prepares
** discuss and *explain* to each other
** share *personal stories*/experiences, add comments, remarks and side notes to make it more *alive*
*** connecting the information in order to improve learning effect
* *motivate* each other, so when one feels down, the other can left you up again
* get it into memory through *repetition* (know your study type)
* share secret tips about *study life*
** common "study-life hacks" (OU specifics, deadlines, legal, infrastructure, exams, discounts et cetera)
** _secret tips_ "where to find what"
** resources (library, study material), discounts

== How to studygroup

* Smaller picture:
* Use *focus questions* to guide the meetings.
* Use further *questions at section end* as well.
* Check each other the *terms* (vocabulary, section end).
* Simply *present* topic to each other
* Either collaborative or single person.
* Random (surprise) selection.
* Create "anker points": Experiences to remember, share personal past experiences / associations.
* Bigger picture:
* First present, *next week repeat* with questions
* Remarks:
** Watch out for "rabbit holes"!
** Stay with content, only slight derail.
** It's already enough material.
** Maybe dedicated extra meetings for that?

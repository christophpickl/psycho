<p>The following terms are often used interchangeably and without proper, precise meaning assigned by most people. Yet, they do have distinct meanings.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cognitive</strong>: Learning/acquiring knowledge, understanding through thought/experience/senses.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Including: Perception, memory, judgment, reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intellectual</strong>: The ability to think logically, reason, understand complex ideas.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using higher-order thinking skills, critical analysis; engaging in a philosophical debate requires intellectual effort and analytical thinking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mental</strong>: All activities with the mind, a broader umbrella term including: Cognitive functions, emotions, attitudes and mental health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Psychological</strong>: The study of the mind/behavior, encompassing mental/emotional states.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Covers: Cognition, emotion, behavior, personality, mental health.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rationality and reason are closely related concepts, but they have distinct meanings and applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rationality</strong>: Quality/state of being reasonable, based on facts/reason.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>To adhere to logic and consistency, thinking coherently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using logic/evidence to make decisions/form beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example: A rational person uses statistical data to make an informed decision about buying a car.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reason</strong>: The ability of the mind to think/understand/form judgments logically.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The mental process of deriving logical conclusions from premises/evidence (drawing inferences, make sense of experiences, establish truth).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using reason, we can deduce that you are mortal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rationality is broader, about thinking quality and decision-making; consistency, coherence, using logic; adherence to logical principles.
Reason means to think logically, understand, and form judgments. The actual mental activity of processing information logically to come to conclusions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A person demonstrating rationality might avoid gambling because they understand the statistical improbability of winning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person using reason might analyze a set of arguments, weigh the evidence, and conclude which argument is more logically sound.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="_science_terminology">Science Terminology</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: A statement which is possible and needs further validation to be proven.
Usually the conditions are stated as well which are needed for validation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Theory</strong>: By verifying a hypothesis through empirical observations a new theory formed, like relativity theory or evolution theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thesis</strong>: A claim which should be proven/disproven by means of scientific evidence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_logic">Logic</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Deduction</strong>: Drawing conclusions from a set of premises (which are assumed to be true). Reasoning from the general to the specific.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example: Premise 1, all men are mortal; Premise 2, I am a man; Conclusion, therefore I am mortal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IF the premises are true, AND the logic is valid, THEN the conclusion must be true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is very safe (compared to induction) yet doesn&#8217;t lead to necessarily "groundbreaking" new insights. A more conservative approach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Induction</strong>: Making generalizations based on specific observations/instances. Reasoning from the specific to the general.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Example: Observation 1, sun has risen everyday east; Observation 2, sun rose east today; Conclusion, sun will rise east tomorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inductive arguments provide probable conclusions (likely to be true, but not guaranteed).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key differences Deduction/Induction:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deduction: from general to specific (induction other way round).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deduction has certainty, induction is probable (based on evidence).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Induction reveals new knowledge (deduction only scratches the surface a bit).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deduction used in math, inductive reasoning in (empirical) sciences and everyday life (observing patters, formulate hypotheses).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Induction example: I give her a rose, she looks angry, thus I conclude she doesn&#8217;t like roses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Axiom</strong> (postulate, assumption): A statement that is considered to be true, and to be used for further reasoning and arguments as a premise.</p>
</li>

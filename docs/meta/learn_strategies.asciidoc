== General Learning Tips

* Chapter 9:
** Sleep immediately (few hours) after learning.
** Recalling (active) is better than studying/reading (passive).
** Elaborative encoding: "How you place new information into your network of associations has a big effect on your ability to retrieve it."
** Self-generated retrieval cues, rather than other-generated improves retrieval.
** Effect on context: Learn and exam in same room, cues help us to remember. (encoding context == retrieval context)

* *Actively process* over passively rereading.
* Understand the *meaning*, question it.
* Build up new *associations*, connect to other knowledge and personal experiences.

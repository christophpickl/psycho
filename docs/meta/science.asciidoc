= Science

"_Science is my religion, logic my god._"

== Method

The scientific method has five basic steps, plus one feedback step:

. Make an *observation*.
. Ask a *question*, basically a best-guess.
. Form a *hypothesis*, or testable explanation.
. Make a *prediction* based on the hypothesis.
. *Test*/verify the prediction.

*Iterate*: use the results to make new hypotheses or predictions.

== Versus Pseudoscience

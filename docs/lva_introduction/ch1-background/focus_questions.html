<li>
<p>(a) What was <strong>Descarte&#8217;s</strong> version of <strong>dualism</strong>? (b) How did it help <strong>pave the way</strong> for a science of psychology?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">(a) Original dualism is the strict separation of body (scientific, as inanimate matter) and mind (supernatural entity).
Descarte gave more power to the body, he saw it as a <strong>complex machine</strong> which does <strong>not need the soul</strong> to, for example, move around or generate its own heat.
His view resembles our current understanding of reflexes.
He based his conclusions on the assumption that <strong>animals have no soul</strong>, still animals and humans perform some of the same actions, thus these activities can occur without a soul. (b) This "allowed" us to study the body, which is behavior and reflexes, with experiments relying on <strong>natural laws</strong>, which was now a bit more detached from the "holy", super-natural soul.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>What reasons can you think of for why <strong>Descarte&#8217;s theory</strong>, despite its intuitive appeal, was <strong>unsuitable</strong> for a complete psychology?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">The mind, and its mental processes, were still inaccessible by science as it is part of the "esoteric".
Behavior by mind, <strong>mind by soul</strong>, soul unreachable as its <strong>immaterial concept</strong>.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did <strong>Hobbe&#8217;s materialism</strong> help lay the groundwork for a science of psychology?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">Materialism, as a follow-up of dualism, reduced not only the body but also the mind/thoughts, therefore <strong>everything, to a physical level</strong>, disregard the concept of an immaterial soul.
"There is nothing but matter", and matter can be understood in terms of physical processes, obeying laws of nature, thus by science.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did the nineteenth-century understanding of the <strong>nervous system</strong> inspire a theory of behavior called <strong>reflexology</strong>?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>[hiddenAnswer]# If there is no soul, then consciousness itself is also bound to human body.
Thus, every behavior, nevertheless how complex, is just a <strong>nervous reaction</strong>, a reflex, to an environmental stimuli, called "reflexology".#</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did discoveries of <strong>localization of function</strong> in the brain help establish the idea that the mind can be studied <strong>scientifically</strong>?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">Instead of the soul, it was the <strong>brain (matter)</strong> which determined human behavior.
Specific brain parts where responsible for different types of tasks, so behavior could be studied in greater detail.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>(a) How would you explain the <strong>origin of complex ideas and thoughts</strong> according to <strong>British empiricism</strong>? (b) What role did the law of <strong>association by contiguity</strong> play in this philosophy?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>[hiddenAnswer]# (a) Children are born with a blank slate ("tabula rasa", John Locke, an "unfurnished room"), and all ideas/thoughts are mere <strong>reflections of sensory experience</strong> by the environment.
Smaller ideas form more complex thoughts. (b) By reducing complex ideas into <strong>a network of linked events</strong>.
When two ideas occured simultaneously (or right after each other, contiguously), they were associated by the mind, and one would trigger the other.
Fragments of ideas, triggered by sensory input, build up complex ideas/thoughts.#</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>How would you describe the influence that <strong>empiricist philosophy</strong> has had on psychology?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">The approach of how we study psychology is still the same: By law of association by contiguity.
It helped us fundamentally to understand how we <strong>learn</strong> (sensory input creating concepts) and <strong>remember</strong> (trigger of one resurfaces another).</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>(a) Why is the ability to <strong>learn</strong> dependent on <strong>inborn</strong> knowledge? (b) In Kant&#8217;s nativist philosophy, what is the distinction between <strong>a priori</strong> and <strong>a posteriori</strong> knowledge?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">(a) <strong>Learning</strong> itself <strong>requires skill</strong>, without that skill, learning itself wouldn&#8217;t be possible. (b) "A priori" is something we are equipped when we were <strong>born</strong>, a pre-furnished room.
"A posteriori" is acquired <strong>after birth</strong>, via sensory experience.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>(a) How did Darwin&#8217;s theory of <strong>natural selection</strong> offer a scientific foundation for <strong>explaining behavior</strong> by describing its functions? (b) How did it provide a basis for understanding the origin of <strong>a priori</strong> knowledge?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">(a) Just like physical aspects, so is behavior passed on in order to <strong>improve survival/reproduction</strong>.
Only what benefits it, will be preserved. (b) Thus, this <strong>passing on</strong> via <strong>natural selection</strong>, makes the next generation&#8217;s behavior already pre-determined by tendencies because of a priori knowledge.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>(a) How do <strong>neural, physiological, genetic and evolutionary</strong> explanations differ from one another and how would you apply these explanations toward an understanding of <strong>jealousy</strong>?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer"><strong>Neural</strong>: Behavior is based on central nervous system.
Complex associations of past experience triggers a neural activity which could be considered jealousy.<br>
<strong>Physiological</strong>: Based on hormones and other molecules/physical processes.
Release of certain hormones (adrenalin) by glands when cognition determines a threat of a rivaling same-sex mating partner.<br>
<strong>Genetic</strong>: Encoded at birth in DNA.
Something like a "jealousy gene" will be passed to children.<br>
<strong>Evolutionary</strong>: Anything that improves chance of survival and reproduction.
Regarding jealousy; Neural: Certain brain areas (amygdala) show increased activity.
For example for a man the uncertainty of whether it&#8217;s his child, and for a woman the chance that children are being taken care of.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>(a) How do <strong>learning and cognitive</strong> explanations differ? (b)How would you apply each of them toward an understanding of <strong>jealousy</strong>?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>[hiddenAnswer]# (a) Learning, in this context, has to do with stimulation from <strong>external</strong> events (environment), whereas the cognitive explanation only relies on <strong>internal</strong> mental processes (knowledge, believes). (b) Learning: By reinforcement of the experience of being successful to avoid pain inflicted by jealousy triggering stimulus.
Cognitive: By observing parents and media/culture and imitate a behavior of jealousy.#</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>(a) How do <strong>social and cultural</strong> explanations differ? (b) How would you apply each of them toward an understanding of <strong>jealousy</strong>?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">(a) The social explanation is based on <strong>individuals and groups</strong> and there values (conformity, obedience).
Whereas cultural observe an <strong>entire culture</strong>, like history, economy, religion or philosophy, and their settled social traditions. (b) Social: When parents, as <strong>role models</strong>, indicate jealousy being an appropriate behavioral response when the relationship is threatened.
Culture: And that, on the other hand, is based on a religious-cultural background, what is considered to be <strong>acceptable</strong>.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>(a) What constitutes a <strong>developmental</strong> explanation? (b) How would you apply a developmental explanation toward an understanding of <strong>jealousy</strong>?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">(a) People go through certain stages while aging, with each having some specific <strong>age-related behavior/changes</strong> (in behavior, emotions and thoughts). (b) By a certain age a young person will feel different "kinds of" jealousy, e.g. regarding <strong>toys</strong>, <strong>attention</strong> from care-takers, in preparation to later on have also a feeling of <strong>sexual</strong> jealousy.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some <strong>research specialities</strong> in psychology that are not defined primarily by the <strong>level of analysis</strong> employed?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">The 9 level of analysis rather determine the "how" research is done, whereas the other specialities mentioned are more about the "what" (topic), such as: sensory psychology, perceptual psychology, psychology of motivation or psychology of emotion.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>(a) What are the three <strong>main divisions</strong> of academic studies? (b) How does psychology link them together?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>[hiddenAnswer]#(a) <strong>Humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences</strong>. (b) It links them by being the center of those three divisions (<strong>hub science</strong>) as our thinking and behavior influences all the other sciences (rather philosophy as one might assume).
Humanities: As psychology is a study of what people do (creations, processes, influences).
Natural sciences: Tied to biology and chemistry (via behavioral neuroscience/genetics, evolutionary psychology).
Social sciences: sociology/anthropology (via social/cutural psychology).

<li>
<p>Why might a knowledge of the <strong>history of philosophical</strong> thought about human behavior benefit an understanding of modern psychology?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">Psychology <strong>originated</strong> from philosophy, it was part of it, emerged out of it.
The early beginnings of philosophy of the mind, the thought, and Descarte&#8217;s dualism, separating the body and the soul stem from philosophers and philosophical thinking of the past.
To understand the present (why it is the way it is) it is useful (maybe even it requires) to understand the past (where it comes from and the cultural/historical background of the people where "minded" back then when modern, western psychology was developed).</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>What, if anything, connects the various <strong>areas of psychology</strong> together?
Is it reasonable to think of psychology as a <strong>single discipline</strong> or does it make more sense to view it as a <strong>collection</strong> of different scientific disciplines?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">The different areas can be imagined as taking a different perspectives from a different angle on the very same object, which is behavior and mind (see the "teapot story").
The separation is artificial but still very useful, to specialize, to be taught and learned.
Underneath still it is a single discipline, as the separation is artificial in the first place.</span></p>

<li>
<p>The biologist E.O. Wilson referred to <strong>consilience</strong> <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> as "the intrinsic unity of knowledge &#8230;&#8203; the linkage of the sciences and humanities." How might psychology fit into Wilson&#8217;s scheme for the integration of knowledge from <strong>physics to the humanities</strong>?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="hiddenAnswer">The brain is physical, it uses electricity, down below it&#8217;s chemistry and physics (like layers on top of each other).
Based on the physical brain, we have thoughts and behavior, which are studied by psychology/humanities and therefor integrating the two.</span></p>

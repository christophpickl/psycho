<h2 id="_overview">Overview</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How does human behavior come about?
What is the role of the brain?
How are we through evolution, development and learning adapted to our environment, so that we can function and grow?
What is consciousness?
How are our emotions expressed?
How do we behave towards others?
These are just a few of the fascinating questions that are central to psychology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Answering these question has, in addition to the acquired knowledge, also practical use.
The knowledge enables the psychologist to analyse what is going wrong with people which have difficulties in life or don&#8217;t function properly in their environment, so that professionally a positive change can be made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The question, what psychology actually is, will be answered very broad.
You will get an overview over the complete domain of psychology, so that you have a solid foundation for the education of psychology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally speaking studies psychology the behavior, emotions and thoughts of humans, in relation to oneself and in relation the body, as well as the social environment.
This course has a particular focus on the ability to adapt of humans.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The course offers a solid, yet accessible basis in the field of evolutionary psychology and theoretical principles with which the capabilities for adaption can be understood.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We then study how the brain is organized, how we perceive sensations and how we experience our self and the world around us.
How we think, reason, solve problems and decide.
You will get insight in our drives and emotions that give shape to our behavior.
Of course these actions always happen in a social context.
People behave differently when they are in a group compared to when they are alone.
People influence each other, consciously or not.
In addition, human behavior changes over the life.
Finally the course will cover psychological disorders and treatments of those.</p>

					<p>Note: The following text uses the word &quot;slow&quot; (first sound in a beat, usually a base-drum, also sometimes the onomatopoeia &quot;boom&quot; is used) and the word &quot;quick&quot; (2nd and 3rd sound in a beat, usually a snare-drum, also sometimes &quot;chic&quot;). A beat (or &quot;block&quot;), thus, is composed of &quot;slow - quick - quick&quot;.</p>

                    <h2>General Advice</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep your <b>arms up</b> (elbows, where the follower rests upon), as it helps to maintain a better connection.</li>
                        <li>Have a <b>recovery attitude</b>: once you made a mistake, just keep the flow.</li>
                        <li>Firm yet <b>soft grip</b>, on torso and shoulders, as it helps with sending a clear intention. The sweet spot between softness (relaxation, presence, breath) and strength (solid, secure guidance).</li>
                        <li>Comfortable <b>distance</b> between the partners, also fine to just ask explicitly.</li>
						<li>Keep your feet always on the ground; <b>slide</b>, don't step! By making a sound, you might make someone happy ;)</li>
						<li>The slow step is reached really <b>far</b> forward and backward.</li>
                    </ul>

					<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Hopping</b> up and down, not keeping the vertical axis still.</li>
						<li>Leader's <b>hands too low</b>, not properly positioned on the shoulder blades.</li>
						<li><b>Rushing</b> the connection to quickly when dancing with a new partner: take your time, slow down.</li>
						<li><b>Looking down</b> on the ground/the feet, instead straight either into the room or (smiling) at your partner, dancing truly with each other.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2 id="Beginner_Basics">Basics</h2>
					<!-- ******************************************************************************************* -->
					<h3 id="Beginner_Basics_Connection">Connection</h3>
					<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
					<ul>
						<li><b>Close</b>: Leader hands on the back (usually shoulder blades, or more embraced) and elbows slightly pushed up and outwards. Follower rest on partner's body depending on distance (usually outside upper arms, or around neck/shoulders if closer).</li>
						<li><b>Open</b>: Hold each other's hands with a loose grip, applying no pressure with the thumbs.</li>
						<li><b>Mixed</b>: One side closed, and the other is open.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 id="Beginner_Basics_Steps">Steps</h3>
					<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
					<ul>
						<li><b>On-Spot</b>: Step only on slow; or even slower (at the very beginning of the dance, or when there is no beat).</li>
						<li>
							<p><b>Basic step</b>: Is the most regular forward-and-backward step universally present in all moves. Using either connecting style (closed or open), the leader starts with his left leg stepping back. The 1st step on the slow gives the direction, the 2nd is to control the force or for direction change (only toes touch, heels up), and the 3rd to ground again. Feet are sliding on the ground (not stepping) and on different lines than partner (&quot;within&quot;) to avoid stepping on each other's feet.</p>
							<div class="center"><img src="zouk/basic.gif" alt="Basic step" width="300" height="300" /></div>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p></p><b>Lateral</b>: Leader is just doing side-steps, the follower on the other hand crosses her steps while always facing to the leader, both moving sideways. The follower waits to feel the pull from the lead to step across.</p>
							<div class="center"><img src="zouk/lateral.gif" alt="Lateral step" width="300" height="300" /></div>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p><b>Transition</b> from basic to lateral, by &quot;<i>sending follower out</i>&quot; (leader stays on the spot during basic), and both are changing their stepping styles.</p>

					<h3 id="Beginner_Basics_Star">Star</h3>
					<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
					<p>Do a 90-degree turn (preferably to the left, as right is more unnatural in Zouk). Be patient, do it only on the short steps, so a pattern of: straight - turn - turn.<br/>
						For the beginning, it's easier to turn while the leader is in the back, but as with the left/right difference, you can also do it while he's in the front.

					<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
					<p>From lateral step, keep holding both hands; on the follower's first quick (let her do the first slow-step), keep her in place and rotate on the spot by giving her a clear spin. After that, identical footwork, arm is once over shoulder then rib cage height.</p>
					<p>More has been done here in the bootcamp: simple exit from lateral to basic with holding the left hand; embrace to jojo; ...</p>

					<h3 id="Beginner_Moves_BodyWave">Body Wave</h3>
					<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
					<p>
						From embrace, once the leader has done his side-step to the right, his next steps will be on the spot -don't travel! Once the follower is turned to the left, make her stop immediately, indicated by staying close and pulling her towards you, as if you want to give her a sideway-hug: Right shoulder, hip and leg touching.
					</p>
					<p>
						The wave for the follower is a simple frontal wave, for the leader, who is faced (almost) straight towards the follower, it's more of a sideways wave; in any case always leading from the shoulder, and feet stay fixed, no steps.<br/>
						You can do the wave either lasting for a full beat or half-beat, for a more relaxed sensation.
					</p>
					<p>
						When a wave towards the back has finished, you can enter again with a side-step to the left, on the boom sound, and lead the follower to an embrace, or immediately transition into basic, as you prefer.
					</p>

						<p class="caption">From lateral, to embrace, to body-wave, quick embrace and return to basic</p>

					<p>
						The body-wave can be reversed, leading from the hips first after led by the shoulders, then immediately going down as the leader and back into embrace. This move is called Chicote (pronounced &quot;chigutsch&quot;).

					<h3 id="Beginner_Moves_Piao">Piao</h3>
					<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
					<p>It's basically turning on the spot: In basic-step, when the leader is in the front, &quot;ground&quot; the follower making it clear to not make further steps, and slowly rotate on the spot (pivot point is between both), with small steps, keeping the rhythm.</p>

					</div>

					<h3 id="Beginner_Moves_Viradinha">Viradinha</h3>
					<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
					<p>
						This is done while in a mixed hand position (left open, right closed), and doing a basic step.
						The leader steps out of the line of the follower (she always stays on a straight line) while going backwards.
						Both are facing in the same direction, the hands are more on the side of the follower, who is then doing a lateral step.
						The leader gives a quick impulse to rotate back again and step into her line, crossing his feet to make space.<br/>
						<i>Attention</i>: Both need a proper frame (arms connected to torso, to hips/feet) for this to work, no noodle limbs but a moderate amount of tension kept for the connection to maintain.<br/>
					 (<i>&quot;virada&quot; means &quot;turn&quot; in Portuguese, and the diminutive &quot;inha&quot; means &quot;little&quot;</i>)</p>
					<p>
						Variation of a &quot;turned Viradinha&quot;: Instead of the follower simple doing a 180-degrees (through a lateral step), it will be a 270-degrees turn clockwise.
						The position is closed again when stepping backwards and rounding up possibly with a regular (CCW) turn to be in the original position.
					</p>
					<p>
						The hand contact is completely unnecessary; that is a general rule, that we don't lead by pushing/pulling the hand, as most of the leading/following is via the frame connection.
						If the follower is not following though, a slow and continuous increasing pressure is applied; again, through once connection to the frame (shoulder and arm).<br/>
						Also, the leader's right hand slides during this move to the other side of the follower's back; this happens automatically if keeping the frame and angles of the arm.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another variation is, once opened up in Viradinha, simply go forward and backward (like a basic step), both looking in the same direction without a turn back (yet).
					</p>

					<h3 id="Beginner_Moves_Lunge">Lunge</h3>
					<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

					<div class="center"><img src="zouk/lunge.gif" alt="Lunge + Turn" width="300" height="300" /></div>
					<p>
						Both hands are firmly embraced around the back, the latissimus dorsi muscle during this move.
						It is similar to the Viradinha: Stepping out of the line, and side-step, yet the footwork is a bit more complex, pivoting the feet.
						The turn itself is done by pushing the follower sideways with one hand and disconnecting the other.
					</p>
					<p>
						The follower keeps the footwork pattern (we always do, all the time, no hopping and jumping or anything weird), and returns to the original position. A common mistake is that the follower moves to the side, stepping away from the line.
						Also watch out not to hit your leader with your elbows (leaders, give enough space), alternatively raise up your arms into the sky (as done with the yoyo).
					</p>
					<p>
						It can be used for playing with musicality, choosing to slow much down, while followers wait the lead to exit the lunge; or keeping it short.
						It is a very effective tool when getting off-beat, to get back in your basic step dancing on time again.

						<p class="caption">Out - pivot - lunge, with some remarks</p>
					</div>

					<p>
						You can also do a lunge hesitate turn: From a basic, start like with the Viradinha, step to the side, pivot on the spot, lunge, and then it is possible to <i>optionally</i> do a &quot;Hesitate&quot; (shifting the weight left and right, with a clear, good connection) before going into a simple turn.<br/>

					<h3 id="Beginner_Moves_Soltinho">Soltinho</h3>
					<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
					<p>
						The name comes from the Portuguese word &quot;solta&quot;, meaning free or loose.
						It is the first more complex move we learned so far, and it will need some time to master it; be patient, be kind.
					</p>
					<p>
						The footwork is more complicated and also used in more complicated, other moves.
						It is recommended to practice it by yourself! First going linear, then in circles.
					</p>
					<p>
						Enter it by doing a lateral step, when moving to the left, keep the arms wide open to give a clear signal to go into circular step.
						When the leader steps with the right leg, she goes/turns (lifting arm up).
						When stepping with the left leg, he goes/turns (put her hand on body, turn, and catch again).
					</p>
					<p>
						Exit is possible everytime the follower, into a lateral step again, indicating it by keeping the arms spread wider open.
					</p>

						From lateral, prepare the right hand, palms touching each other.

						We also played with inviting and recognizing an appropriate <b>distance</b>, letting the follower come by opening up, inviting space to come as close as desired, not using any force and respecting each other's comfort zone.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also learn how to <b>soften</b> a bit and tap into the more subtle qualities of a partner dance.
						Simple things like the qualities of expansion and contraction, but also the fundamental source of relaxation: the <b>breath</b>.
						Doing a quick <b>body scan</b>, dropping the chest, bending the knees.
						When dancing with a new/unknown partner, or the unknown happens, instead of tensing up, simply let go, relax, and recover.<br/>
						Speaking of <b>unknown partner</b>: Before immediately and right away start dancing, first establish eye contact, say &quot;hi&quot;, smile, and give it a few moments to connect; groove on the beat, and then slowly build up the technical moves.

					<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
					<p>The social guidelines are printed out and put on the bar, yet here again:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>In our community, we give each other honest <b>feedback</b> and talk things through.</li>
						<li>We value <b>hygiene</b>, good smells, and fresh shirts.</li>
						<li>We <b>approach</b> each other to ask for a dance, are free to say &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; and stop the dance if we feel to do so.</li>
						<li>We <b>start slowly</b> with a new partner, maybe weight shift to more complex techniques, going through a mental checklist, building it up, and sketching a picture.</li>
						<li>We feel free to share our experienced qualities after the dance, communicate our boundaries, and in extreme cases, talk to the organizers for support.</li>
					</ul>

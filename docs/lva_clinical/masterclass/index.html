<p>Divided into 4 subparts:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Orientation psychological disorders and theoretical perspectives</strong>: On the first day of the masterclass, you orientate yourself on the subject and the theoretical frames of reference. You will be presented with a number of cases and you will be asked to interpret the complaints and symptoms according to different frames of reference. This first day ends with an interview with Jannes Eshuis about the usefulness of the theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diagnosis and Classification of Disorders</strong>: The second day focuses on the instruments used to estimate the nature and severity of psychological complaints, and on the classification of different disorders. The emphasis is on various tests, an introduction to the DSM and a number of common disorders, about which you will read a number of articles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A Critical Look at the Classification of Mental Disorders</strong>: On the third day we will take a critical look at the classification of mental disorders and the advantages and disadvantages of the DSM. The day starts with an interview with Trudy Dehue about classification and diagnosis. Then you perform a number of assignments on this theme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Occupational therapy</strong>: The fourth and final day is about online psychotherapy within clinical psychology. The day is dominated by an interview with a psychotherapist from practice. You can ask questions about this interview to the examiner of the course by e-mail.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<li>
<p>It consists of interviews with Jannes Eshuis, and  Trudy Dehue, and articles.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Task 1a</strong>: Which of the following 7 factors for abnormal behavior do you personally think are most/least characteristic and why? (see <a href="../thema1/chapter1_about.html#seven_factors">Chapter 1 / Seven factors of abnormal behavior</a>)</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Personal suffering</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Very high, as mental suffering is rather subjective, and it&#8217;s difficult to reliably define pathology based on absolute terms when taking socio-cultural background into account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dysfunctional behavior</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Very high, as due to dysfunctional behavior, I can imagine also suffering can result. If</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Irrational / Incomprehensible behavior</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Very low, as maybe for that person it is rational/comprehensible, just not for the observer/psychologist. As long as there is no consequences which leads to an experienced suffering, I see no real problem there.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unpredictability / Loss of control</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Low, as it leads to more comfort if there is more predictability in behavior, yet not required to life a fulfilled life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unconventional/notable behavior</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Very low, as this seems rather arbitrary to me. Neither my own potential behavior, nor social norms should determine what is pathological/abnormal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discomfort evoking behavior</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Very low, as although crossing implicit social norms lead to discomfort, it is not really severe to the person self.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violating moral norms</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>High, as in order to guarantee a functioning society, we need to adhere moral norms, not necessarily superficial social norms though.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Task 1b</strong>: Do external factors (such as social environment, culture, media, pharamceutical industry) influence on the common conception of abnormal behavior? Why?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, very much. Just think of media like TV, which basically influences most of our ideas around what is good and bad, healthy and sick. Media is tied to culture and social environment, which can&#8217;t be separated. Whatever our mother told is, when it is justified to stay away from "strange people". Our conception (misconception?) of when someone "misbehaves" is not necessarily something defined by natural impulses, but rather has been developed over the years by observation and imitation. Additionally, the pharmaceutical industry might have added its own share, as their (commercial) interest is of course to sell more products, which they can&#8217;t be blame for as this is their goal in our self-created capitalistic system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_theoretical_perspective">Theoretical Perspective</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A theory is created, whenever we succeeded in putting together concepts in a consistent system of terms which are put together in a logical way. These are being used to look at development and continuation of psychological disorders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a clinical psychologist it is of utmost importance to have good knowledge about clinical theories (such as: neurobiological, learn, cognitive, psychodynamic, humanistic, systemic). They can be used to figure out causes/consequences and tailorize treatments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_task_2">Task 2</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Case study</strong>: Ms. Smit, 66 years, who&#8217;s husband died 4 years ago. She still misses him daily. Stopped working 2 years ago. She is sad and lost her motivation. Sleeps bad. Can&#8217;t focus, even TV and newspapers won&#8217;t work. Stopped painting. Eats only fast food, although used to cook for friends and family. She thinks people don&#8217;t like her paintings, her food, her company; although trying to be social. She thinks others can&#8217;t put themselves into her position, thus she retreats into her house. Little contact with her kids. Hasn&#8217;t asked for help yet. She doesn&#8217;t mind dying, as life has no meaning to her anymore.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Task</strong>: How can her complaints and symptoms be explained with the help of the cognitive approach (Ellis/Beck schemas)? How can they be complained from a learn-theoretical approach?</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Cognitive:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Neurotic problems like depression stem from illogical/irrational ideas of people. Ellis emphasized the relevance of irrational conceptions for neurotic psychopathologies. Beck developed a theory for specific cognitive characteristics for different forms of psychopathology (e.g. depression).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depressogene schemas (according to Beck) lead to thoughts about worthlessness and guilt. The unjustice of the world. Lovelessness of others. Being hopeless in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient thinks she must be appreciated and liked by literally everyone (illogical/irrational thought). Her depressogene schemas also express themselves as she thinks her paintings are not appreciated, people are not interested in her and her dinner parties. That others don&#8217;t like her company, not even her children. Her thoughts are about abandonment and hopelessness. Daily thinking about her husband, not seeing a future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Depression can develop once a social support is lost. People&#8217;s behavior is not positively reinforced/rewarded anymore. Important concepts: Avoidance and learned helplessness (Seligman; own behavior has no impact on situation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The patient has no husband and no colleagues anymore. She feels like she is not rewarded by other people, e.g. appreciated because of her paintings, dinner parties and her pro-social behaviour, although she tries so hard. She has no control any more (learned helplessness).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She avoids potentially pleasurable activities. Retreats. Consequence: Even less rewarded from environment, and less control over her situation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_task_3">Task 3</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Case study</strong>: Ravi was born in India, his single mom gave him free for adaption. He got adopted by Dutch parents, which themselves got children themselves, which lead to him receiving less attention. He is calm, adapted, sub-assertive. He gets mobbed in school, which he suffers from but his parents think he will get stronger from it. By age 18 he is in a psychiatric department, as he can&#8217;t focus and learn anymore for his exams, and has the idea that his thoughts "run in chaos", without him being able to stop them. He thinks he is getting crazy, hearing an angry voice, telling him statements of non-self-worth and he should end his life, and also that he was the wrong child for his adoptive parents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Task</strong>: How can the complaints and symptoms from Ravi explained with the help of neurobiological and systemic approach respectively?</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Neurobiological</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Psychopathology is the result of interaction between predisposition (inborn vulnerability) and a stress-increasing environment (personal circumstances). Schizophreny means having a high amount of receptors, meaning the neuron can easily be stimulated to fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is possible that Rafi has an increased inherited risk for neurological over-sensitivity. The stress evoced by the upcoming exam might have resulted in such an over-excitement, leading to lack of concentration and hearing voices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Systemic</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The systemic approach is an umbrella term for interpersonal processes, such as for the communication theory. Dysfunctional/sickening communication patterns within the family lead to psychopathology. Yet another approach is the structural approach, which sees the family as an ever-changing social system, which has to adapt to internal as well as external (social) changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rafi&#8217;s position is rather weak in his family due to his adoption. The combination of new (own) children and his personality of being more adaptive and sub-assertive might have lead to dysfunctional communication patterns; confirmed by the reaction of him being mobbed by his parents. Thus, it is difficult for Rafi to develop healthy in this family.</p>

<li>
<p>What is the use of so many theories around psychopathology?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is a theory?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Science is human work. A scientist is just a human (just more systematically).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He does what all humans do: Trying to understand the world around him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our experience (such as perception from senses) is not correlating with the complete reality.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>E.g. vision is limited to a certain range of light (there is something beyond); same for hearing, only certain frequencies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, biases are at work, most prominent the <a href="../../phenomena/confirmation_bias.html">confirmation bias</a> and <a href="../../phenomena/attribution_bias.html">attribution bias</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is a use of a theory?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Represents a conviction of the "world out there", which we cannot know directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convictions guide our thoughts and behavior. Expectations over the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Theory cannot be avoided, it always happens (like an implicit model we create over reality).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For scientist this happens explicit, so critical/empirical research is possible. Systematic discussions, consent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinical psychology?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In psychology, they have time to reason about a single problem; in health-care they need to act with a patient immediately for an ever-changing situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, the patient has his own theories/models about the world. In CBT patient and therapist work together, figuring out wrong cognitions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are there so many theories?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>"There are as many theories as are there people."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In science, we try to find consent, to pick only the relevant/effective/reliable ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E.g. Freud&#8217;s classical psychoanalysis (and the branches like from Jung): Nice metaphors in there, but what is the use in explaining reality? Not like analogies, which are more useful. The therapist is always right; No falsification, either patient agrees or it&#8217;s a defense mechanism. Only explanation backwards, but no future prognosis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychoanalysis was the early beginning of clincial psychology. Defense mechanisms, ego- and drift-psychology (back then lot sexually centered). Focus on past; upbringing &amp; childhood; e.g. attachment theory (insecure if parents are not available).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not a single approach can explain everything. Everyone has its limitations.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>E.g.: Biological approach can potentially be effective by prescribing drugs. Psychopharmaca to be able to solve underlying issue with psychotherapy can be considered to be good; giving those drugs for rest of the life (as a solution for e.g. depressions) is rather bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are not necessarily competeting/exclusive, but rather complementary to each other. Each can be used for different purposes and can be integrated with each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learntheoretical (behaviorism) and cognitive have a more deterministic view on human existence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is useful to have different approaches, each with their own strength and usable for different circumstances/purposes, and can indeed be used in parallel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is maybe even expected to have more than one theoretical approach ready as a clinical psychologist ("not everything can, and should, be solved via, for example, a humanistic approach; although very useful").</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ad humanism: Carl Roger&#8217;s attitude is great: Empathetical, judgementfree, supportive. But: Not all problems can be solved with this!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question is: Which tool is suitable for which problem?!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about psychologist&#8217;s own created approach?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Science has to stay moving / ever-changing.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>E.g. acupuncture. Argument is that it is an authority because it is 2500 years old. From scientific perspective this is actually a counterargument, as it was not changed since then. Not critically investigated whether something needs to be changed/improved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, actually a good thing. It just has to be properly established. Not just follow own idea, but put it into the public scientific community, so it can be discussed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Especially for students it is good to come up with own ideas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is his favorite approach?</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is not a single, right perspective!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other than that, CBT has the highest evidence given so far. Maybe in combination with neurobiological approach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_task_4">Task 4</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Task 4a</strong>: Why are there so many theories about psychopathology? And what is the difference between "the man on the street" and scientists/healthcare-professionals?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because every theory has its focus: It&#8217;s like having different tools for different problems. And a scientist is someone who has a more systematic approach, using well proven procedures and empirical research, challenges one&#8217;s own "babies" critically (to counteract confirmation bias; also see attribution bias), and allows his theories to be challenged in public, instead using a "filtered version of reality" like ordinary people. Healthcare-professionals are always faced with a slightly different problem for each patient, contrary to the scientist which is focused on a single (theoretical) problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Task 4b</strong>: Which theory is best, and what is it dependent on?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Non is the best, there are only different perspectives with different applications. Nevertheless, CBT and the neurobiological approach have proven to be most effective so far.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Task 4c</strong>: What is the advantage of those theories for someone with a mental disorder, for healthcare professionals (HCP) respectively?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no real use for the patient, but for HCPs: It leads to the most appropriate treatment. Often a learn-theoretical/cognitive approach in combination with a neurobiological (psychopharmaca) can be useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Task 4d</strong>: What is the usefulness of psychoanalysis?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is quite some criticism towards Freud&#8217;s original psychoanalysis, as it contains many metaphors and mythological terminology, thus it loses capability for explanations. Also the "therapist always right" attitude is questionable (admit or defense mechanism). Whereas in the meantime it has been considerable evolved. Suppressed drives are not that important anymore, but the childhood still is. For example within the attachment theory, which states our early relations will determine our later relationships we have.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Task 4e</strong>: How about that HCPs have their own theoretical framework?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally it&#8217;s not bad, but it has to be challenged critically and verified (according to the scientific process), because if not, it has potential dangers with it. So for example acupuncture which has not changed for 2500 years, thus has not adopted to later insights/improvements.</p>

<h3 id="_task_1_2">Task 1</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Many people think that Bill Gates has developed the corona virus to make money from the vaccine, others think the vaccination manipulates our DNA or contain microchips so the government can control us. According to the definition of "abnormal behavior", do those people have a psychological disorder or just an opinion which deviates from the consent?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The 7 criteria for abnormal beahvior are the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Personal suffering: Just having another opinion doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that there is a directly associated suffering, whereas indirectly it could lead to disadvantages in daily life, once one is not aligned with the opinion with the majority. The conflicts which arise, by for example not wearing a facemask whereas it is considered to be mandatory, or the limitations in life in general because of not being vaccinated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dysfunctional behavior: It seems not obvious to me why the behavior should not lead to functional outcome. Yet, for example at work it could be possible that there are certain limitations once one&#8217;s convictions lead to disobedience (not getting vaccinated).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Irrational / Incomprehensible behavior: The beliefs those people have lack any rational, logical reasoning, thus also their behavior could be considered irrational. Yet, by looking deeper, there is a certain (although maybe flawed) logic underneath, which in this case is coping with uncertainty and fear, by having "some kind" of explanation gives comfort, rather living in this complex, uncertain, ambigious world with a virus we don&#8217;t know much about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unpredictability / Loss of control: Definitely not the case, as their behavior does show an effect (not getting vaccinated), as well is the cause of their behavior explainable, yet different from what the consent is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unconventional/notable behavior: Yes, as this kind of non-conforming and socially undesirable behavior (not getting vaccinated increases the risks of other people&#8217;s death) is usually considered pathological.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discomfort evoking behavior: Yes, as usually those convictions lead to behavior such as already mentioned by not wearing a facemask, which leads to other people feeling discomfort. Also having not vaccinated people around means an increased risk of getting infected. Those things are though more explicit, than implicit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Violating moral norms: As social creatures, we are obliged to take care of each other, live up to a responsibility to obey for the greater good, and considering that a vaccination helps to prevent a pandemic and the deaths of millions, it is very much considered a violation of moral norms (the moral value of protecting each other from harm) to believe in explanations which bare any foundation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My personal judgement is, that it is not sufficiently "abnormal" enough in order to be justified as a psychological disorder. Some of those people might be stronger already into a psychosis (people which already before had a predisposition towards psychosis, as many conspiracy theorists are), some of them can be considered totally reasonable people, being able to be talked to reason, and functioning perfectly fine in society otherwise.</p>

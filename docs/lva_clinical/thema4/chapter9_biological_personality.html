<h2 id="_definitions">Definitions</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Adoption studies</strong> (also see Twin studies): Establish genetic-behavior relationships, by comparing biological siblings reared together VS apart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Behavioral genetics</strong>: Study of genetic contributions to behaviors, by comparing similarity among individuals of varying degrees of biological-genetic similarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Effortful control</strong>: Capacity to control one&#8217;s actions by stopping one activity (dominant response) in order to do another; a quality of temperament.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evolved psychological mechanisms</strong> (evolutionary psychology): Mechanisms resulted out of evolution by selection (adaptive for survival/reproduction).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>fMRI</strong> (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging): Brain-imaging technique; recording changes of blood flow (thus implied more neuronal activity, as needs more "fuel").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heritability</strong>: Proporation of variance in scores, specific population, attributed to genetic factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inhibited-uninhibited temperaments</strong>: Inhibited child reacts to unfamiliar persons/events with restraint/avoidance/distress, takes longer to relax, more unusual fears/phobias. Uninhibited child enjoy these things, responding with spontaneity/laughter/smiles easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>nature VS nurture</strong>: heredity, genetic, biology VS environment, learned, social (by <a href="../../people/galton-francis.html">Sir Francis Galton</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neurotransmitters</strong>: Chemical substances, transmitting information among neurons (e.g. dopamine, serotonine).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Parental investment theory</strong>: Women have greater investment in offspring than men (fewer genes passed on).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phrenology</strong>: Early 19th century attempt, location of brain arease responsible for emotions/behavior; developed by Gall; discredited as quackery/superstition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plasticity</strong>: Ability to change (of neurobiological systems), within limits of genes, to meet current adaptive demands and as a result of experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Proximate causes</strong>: Explanations for behavior associated with current biological processes in the organism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Selective breeding</strong>: Establish genetic-behavior relationships, by breeindg particular characteristics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-/Shared environments</strong>: Comparison in behavioral genetics research, effects of siblings growing up in same/different environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3D temperament model</strong>: Three superfactors as temperaments: PE (Positive Emotion), NE (Negative Emotion) and DvC (Disinhibition versus Constraint).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Twin studies</strong> (also see Adoption studies): Establish genetic-behavior relationships, by comparing identical/fraternal/nontwin siblings.</p>

<h2 id="_temperament">Temperament</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Definition: Biologically based individual differences in emotional&amp;motivational tendencies (evident early in life)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Children are already showing signs of (different) temperaments; variation in styles of emotion and behavior</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Their world experiences are so limited, thus it cannot be product of social experience; it must be biological</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E.g. experiencing positive/negative moods, aroused in response to stimuli, or calm oneself down after being upset</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_early_view">Early view</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Greece:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hippocrates posited his theory on the four bodily fluids (blood, black bile, yellow bile, phlegm)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflecting beliefs about the universe, which consists of nothing but: air, earth, fire water</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus four temperaments: sanguine (cheerful, optimistic), melancholic (loyal, calm, orderly), choleric (practical, analytical, tough), phlegmatic (intuitive, agreeable, warm)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lasted for two millenia! Even Immanuel Kant based on this.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gall&#8217;s phrenology: Idea that shape of skull leads to indications of brain functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three critical publications:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>"The Origin of Species" (1859, Charles Darwin), science of biology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals" (1872, Charles Darwin), study of temperament, and base of evolutionary psychology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Experiments on Plant Hybrids" (1865, Gregor Mendel); breeding, base of genetics</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_longitudinal_studies">Longitudinal Studies</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Longitudinal studies observe people over an extended period of time; something which was missing for studying temperaments a long time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question is: Are these psychological qualities evident in early life and enduring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infant characteristics measured like: activity level, general mood, attentions pan, persistence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three types of babies:</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>easy: playful, adaptable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>difficult: negative, unadaptable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>slow-to-warm-up: low in reactivity, mild responses</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also used parental ratings of children based on dimensions like: emotionality, activity and sociability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Studies found result: There is a link between early temperament and later personality characteristics</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_uninhibited_children">Un/inhibited Children</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Research (by Kagan et al) about biological bases of temperament</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Direct observation of children&#8217;s behavior in a lab setting</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Result are two types of children&#8217;s temperaments: <strong>Uninhibited and inhibited</strong> children</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Inhibited children react to unfamiliar persons/events with restraint/avoidance/distress, takes longer to relax, more unusual fears/phobias.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uninhibited children enjoy these things, responding with spontaneity/laughter/smiles easily.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those types are pretty stable over the years (=consistent over time)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yet again: Enviornment plays a considerable role, allowing people&#8217;s temperemant to change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kagan says: "Any predisposition conferred by our genetic endowment is far from being a life sentence; there is no inevitable adult outcome of a particular infant temperament" yet "it is very difficult to change one&#8217;s inherited predisposition completely"</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neuroimaging shows: amygdala involved (fear response) and frontal cortex (emotional regulation)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Social experiences can modify brain functioning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirmed by fMRI scans of adults (before grouped as strong un/inhibited children), showing familiar/novel faces; amygdala reactivity differs</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>On molecular basis (at least for mice), a protein called "stathmin" could be found, influencing amygdala&#8217;s functioning</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yet: Don&#8217;t overinterpret the influence of biological foundations of personality!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amygdala has many different responsibilities then fear response, and also is the only biological mechanism in fear response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People with amygdala damage do not differ in their fear response</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It may have more to do with novelty than fear: "a state of surprise is a more reliable incentive for amygdalar activation than a state of fear" (Kagan)</p>
</li>

<h3 id="_effortful_control">Effortful Control</h3>
<div class="ulist">

<p>How to influence/regulate emotions/actions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effortful control: stop one thing in order to do another</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Or: "The ability to suppress a dominant response in order to perform a subdominant response"</p>

<h3 id="_behavioral_genetics">Behavioral Genetics</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>&#8230;&#8203; is the study of genetic contributions to behavior</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three primary research methods/studies: selective breeding, twin, adoption</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Selective Breeding Studies</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Desired trait can be selected by a selection/reproduction process with successive generations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E.g. breed barking/fearful dogs; also used outside research (race horses, dogs with certain characteristics)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Helps to understand genetical difference VS different environmental rearing conditions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of blaming it to the individual person (e.g. alcohol addiction) we can see the role of genes</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twin Studies</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>As we don&#8217;t want to do selective breeding studies with humans, twins help out a lot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identical twins (monozygotic; MZ) develop from same fertilized egg VS fraternal twins (dizygotic; DZ) genetically similar as any sibling (50%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As (identical) twins are genetically identical, the only difference is the environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also when they (fraternal twins, regular siblings) share the same environment, but have different genes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interestingly, although MZs reared apart, and meet in later adulthood, they show same personalities</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adoption Studies</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Same environment, different genes (or same if identical twins)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interesting to compare with biological/adoptive parents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also nice to include biological and adoptive children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding: The more genetically similar, to more similar the IQ (high correlation): Strong genetic contribution to intelligence</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heratibility Coefficient</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Also called "h2" (squared, as the numbers are squared when computing variations around an average score)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Representing proportion of observed variance in scores, attributed to genetics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If MZ twins are not any more similar than DZ, then there is no genetic effect: h2 is zero</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If MZ differs greatly from DZ, then h2 is large (upper limit is 1.0, or 100%)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the h2 is lower, then there are other factors than genetics at play (environmental)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note: h2 refers to the population examined in a given study; it does not indicate how genetics influence individual characteristics</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heratibility of Personality</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Two key quotes summarizes it (mostly from twin/adoption studies):</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>"It is difficult to find psychological traits that reliably show no genetic influence"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"For almost every behavioral trait so far investigated, from reaction time to religiosity, an important fraction of the variation among people turns out to be associated with genetic variation. This fact need no longer be subject to debate"</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identical twins, reared apart, sometimes not only look and sound alike, but also share same attitudes, hobbies and preferences for pets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Criticism: Studies are mostly based on self-report questionnaire methods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warning: Heritability estimate is a population statistic; variation between people in the overall population (not speaking about a single individual)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although there is an inherited component in personality traits, they still can change (through environmental experiences)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>E.g. height is significantly determined by genes, but can be influenced by nutrition in childhood</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Molecular genetic paradigms</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The behavior-genetic paradigm is outdated today, nowadays we look more at the underlying biology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify specific genes, how linked to personality traits; show genetic variations/alleles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E.g. a gene that coes for an enzyme that lowers neurotransmitters that are linked to aggressive behavior (similar with depression)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>40-50% variance for single personality characteristics and personality overall, determined by genetic factors</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rest of the population variance = environmental effects and measurement errors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Genetic influence is so ubiquitous and pervasive in behavior, that a shift in emphasis is warranted: ask not what is heritable; ask instead what is not heritable" yet at the same time "other message is, that the same behavioral genetic data yield the strongest available evidence for the importance of environmental influence"</p>

<li>
<p>Non-/shared environments</p>

<ul>

<p>Again the good old "nature / nurture" debate (of behavioral genetics)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared env.: environmental influences making siblings more alike (same experiences, same family)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonshared env.: creating differences among siblings who grow up in the same family (treated differently by parents)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding: Shared env. effects has only little impact on personality; nonshared are large though</p>

<p>NE:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>high = threatened, problematic, distressed</p>

<p>Although PE&amp;NE seem opposite-sounding, we can have both high/low at the same time (controlled by different internal biological systems)</p>

<p>DvC (serotonin, testosterone): style of affective regulation</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>high = impulsive, reckless</p>

<p>Links biology and personality:
* <strong>Amygdala</strong>: Part of primitiv limbic system; emotional response center; aversive emotional learning.
* <strong>Hemispheric Lateralization</strong>: right frontal = negative emotions, shyness, inhibition; left = positive emotions, boldness, disinhibition.
* <strong>Dopamine</strong>: Neurotransmitter; reward, reinforcement, pleasure. High = positive emotions, energetic, disinhibition, impulsivity. Low = lethargy, anxiety, constriction.
* <strong>Serotonin</strong>: Neurotransmitter; mood, irritability, impulsivity. Low = depression, violence, impulsivity. See SSRIs.
* <strong>Cortisol</strong>: Hormone; stress-realted, facilitates threat-reaction; secreted by adrenal cortex; adaptive for short-term stress, chronic stress leads to depression/memory loss.
* <strong>Testosterone</strong>: Hormone; secondary sex characteristic development; dominance, competitiveness, aggression.</p>

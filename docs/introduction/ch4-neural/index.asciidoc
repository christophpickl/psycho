.Anatomy of a neuron
image::images/neuron.jpg[Neuron Anatomy,500]

.Classes of neurons. Left: Sensory neurons send into the SNS from sensory organs (e.g. skin). Bottom: Motor neurons send from CNS to muscles/glands. Right: Interneurons are entirely located within the CNS.
image::images/neuron_classes.jpg[Neuron classes,400,100]

.Common parts of a neuron by example of a motor neuron, sending its signal from dendrites, through the body, down to the axon and axon terminals.
image::images/neuron_motor.jpg[Motor neuron,500,100]

.A neuron's cell membrane. Negative proteins are inside (A-) as well as potassium (K+). Sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) are outside. The permeable membrane lets potassium out (diffusion), thus more positive charge outside, thus inside is negative with 70mV.
image::images/resting_potential.jpg[Resting potential,500,100]

.Electrical change during an action potential.
image::images/action_potential.jpg[Action Potential,500,100]

.Action potential reaches an axon terminal: Synaptic vesicles release transmitter into synaptic cleft, some diffuse at receptors on postsynaptic membrane, opening gates. For excitatory synapses (as in this example), sodium (Na+) flows in. For inhibitory synapse, chloride (Cl-) flows in.
image::images/synapse_transmission.jpg[Synapse transmission,500,100]

.Neurons receive signals inside the CNS from many neighbours, either exciting or inhibiting them. All synapses from a single neuron are either excitatory or inhibitory.
image::images/synapse_excitatory_inhibitory.jpg[Synapse excitation inhibition,500,100]

.Change of synapse density over time, by first sharp production and then pruning to sculpt to its adult form.

.Brain structures.
image::images/brainstructures.jpg[Brain structures,400,100]

.The stem-like continuation from the spinal chord, called "brainstem", consists of medulla, pons and midbrain. Attached on top of it the thalamus.
image::images/brainstem.jpg[Brainstem,400,100]

.Cerebellum ("small brain") and the basal ganglia are important for initiation/coordination of movement.
image::images/cerebellum.jpg[Cerebellum,400,100]

.The limbic system which consists of the hippocampus and amygdala, which strong connections to the hypothalamus. Pituitary gland is controlled by the hypothalamus.
image::images/limibic_system.jpg[Limbic system,400,100]

.Four lobes of the cortex along with primary motor/sensory areas.
image::images/cerebral_cortex.jpg[Cerebral Cortex,400,100]

.Tophographic organization of somatosensory and primary motor areas, with proportionaley devoted tissue for more sensitive/delicate body parts.
image::images/topography.jpg[Topography,400,100]

.Control of movement by cerebral cortex. PFC integrates information and makes a plan. Premotor converts plan into neural programs, finally executed by cerebellum & basal ganglia & primary motor cortex.
image::images/movement_control.jpg[Movement Control,400,100]

.Hierarchy of motor control: Top to bottom, from more global to finer details. Cortical as well as subcortical structures are involved in the top three layers of this model.

== Hormones

* Chemical messengers
* Duration
** Short, e.g. stress
** Long, Permanent
* Sex drive
** Testosterone
*** Confidence boost
*** Competition, aggression
** Fertility
*** Adrenal androgens
* Influences behavior
** Growth
** Metabolism
** Brain activity
*** Drives
*** Moods
* Endocrine glands
** Pituitary
*** "Mastergland"
*** Controlled by brain
** Pineal
** Thyroid, Parathyroid
** Adrenal
** Pancreas
** Gonads
*** Testes
*** Ovaries

.Endocrine glands secrete hormones into the bloodstream. The pituitary, controlled by the brain, control production of other glands (thyroid, adrenals, ovaries/testes).
image::images/endocrine_glands.jpg[Endocrine Glands,400,100]

.Neurosecretory cells inside the hypothalamus control the pituitary gland. Either into the posterior, then into the bloodstream. Or into the anterior, some "releasing factors", stimulating release of other hormones.
image::images/hypothalamus_pituitary.jpg[Hypothalamus Pituitary,400,100]

== Hemispheres

* Corpus Collosum
** Bridge between both hemispheres
* Split-brain
** When bridge is cut through
** Independent study
* Left
** Language production
** Rationalization: Contradictory actions
* Right
** Visuspatial
* Aphasia
** Borca
** Wernicke

.The corpus callosum is a "axon bridge" connecting both hemispheres.
image::images/corpus_callosum.jpg[Corpus Callosum,400,100]

.Some neural pathways from eyes to the hemispheres cross at the optic chiasm.
image::images/vision_pathway.jpg[Vision Pathway,400,100]

.Testing apparatus for split-brain subjects: Flashing stimulus in either visual field, and ask subject to identify the object with his hand. He will touch the pencil (left visual field, right hemisphere), but he will verbally answer he has seen an apple (right visual field, left hemisphere = speech)
image::images/splitbrain_test.jpg[Splitbrain Test,400,100]

.Evidence that the right hemisphere has superior spatial skills: Split-brain patient was right handed, still he was better with his left hand, controlled by his right hemisphere.
image::images/hemisphere_right_spatial.jpg[Right hemisphere spatial,400,100]

.The left-hemisphere language areas, with damage to Broca's area making one incapable of building fluid, grammatically complete sentences, but still deliver the point. Damage to Wernicke's though has the opposite effect on speech production, and impairs comprehension.

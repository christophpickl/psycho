== Cheatsheet

* Example of Oskar Pfungst's horse "Clever Hans":
** Using blinds, prevent observers from unintentionally giving hints (head/eyebrows movement)
* Term definitions:
** Observation = Objective statement, agreed to be true (patterns)
** Theory = Conceptual model, explaining existing observations
** Hypothesis = Prediction from a theory
** Theory-observations = Speculation; Observations-theory = Simple data
* Good scientific research:
.. Skepticism = Try to disprove (via testing); be genuine; test rather accept claims
.. Control = The conditions; rule out alternative explanations
.. Expectations = Subject/observer ("read"/perceive expectations/cues, politeness/liking)
* Research strategies:
.. Design:
... Experiments: cause-effect, in/dependent variable (other constants); within-subject/between-groups (Hans/DiMascio's depresseds; random assignment)
... Correlational studies: No manipulation, just observation; systematic relationship; can't conclude cause (vs causality)
... Descriptive studies: No relationships/maybe numbers/no correlation (not to test!); e.g. 30 year chimps; correlational coefficient
.. Setting:
... Field: no control, natural environment (home, work); => corr./descr. studies
... Laboratory (opposite of Field): designated area; control/uniform; strange/artificial (interference) => experiments
.. Data-collection:
... Self-report: rate/describe mind/behavior; questionnaire/interview; lose/structured; self/other
... Introspection: subjective/unconfirmable; neural confirms introspection!
(Wundth)
... Observation: naturalistic abs. (not interfer) => Hawthorne
* Statistics
.. Descriptive: mean, median, standard deviation, variability
*** Correlation coefficient: statistical significant (strength/direction); p<0.05 (statistical != practical significance)
.. Inferential: chance/probability when experiement repeated, relationships)
*** p elements: size of effect, number of subjects, variability
* Bias = "non-random/directed effects by extraneous factors"
** vs random variation: "bias => wrong bow" (localized cluster); "rand.var. => beginner shoots" (scattered); or both (scattered cluster)
.. Samples: Non-random between-groups => systematic differences; false conclusions; WEIRD societies
.. Measure: Reliability, operational definition; variability; validity; face validity/criterion
.. Expectancy: observer/subject expectancy bias; unintentionally/unaware; observer/double-blind-studies
.. Replicating: Reproduce same studies/results
* Ethics
** Humans: privacy, anonymity, consent; discomfort/pain to minimum; deceiving; can quit, debriefing
** Animals: breed/surgical; applicable to humans; balance suffer-gain; well cared; minimum of suffering


[#sec-clever_hans]
== Clever Hans

.Clever Hans with his owner Mr. von Osten during a mathematics lesson.
image::images/clever_hans.jpg[Clever Hans,300,100]

* The psychologist Oskar Pfungst and the "smart" horse Hans; Germany, 1907.
* Everyone *believed* it could do sophisticated intellectual tasks.
** Especially the owner believed it, and there was no evidence of trickery.
* By using *blindfolds*, Hans could not provide the right answer anymore.
** At the end it turned out *unaware cues* of the audience (e.g. nodding) gave the right answer.

=== Lessons Learned

This story provides us with three main take-aways:

. Increased awareness of the importance of *skepticism*.
** Scientific testing: Disprove yourself, genuinely, repeatedly.
** The marvelous skill of critical thinking, in order to develop alternative perspectives and tests to evaluate them.
** Testing: Over simply accepting claims (belief).
** Still many rational people believe in astrology, telepathy or other occult phenomena, despite they consistently failed when subjected to controlled tests.
** Related to the principle of parsimony, or more popular known as "_Occam's razor_":
*** When there are two competing explanations and equally are able to account for a phenomenon, the simplest one is preferred.
. The value of careful observations under *controlled conditions*.
** Rule out alternatives (e.g. using blinders).
** With/without single, specific aspects; then observe and record.
. The problem of *observer-expectancy effect*.
* Observers/researchers have certain expectations, subjects perceive them and behave differently.
* Observer's unconscious cues reveal the intention of the experiment and subjects act accordingly.

Terminology:

- *Theory*: Idea/conceptual model, explaining/predicting observations.
- *Hypothesis*: Specific, testable prediction ("best guesses") based on a theory.
- *Observation*: Objective statements about behavior (speculative/data).

[#sec-research_strategies]
== Research Strategies

In psychology, we usually categorize research strategies in three dimensions:

. Research Design (experiment, correlational-, descriptive study)
. Setting (lab, field)
. Data-collection Method (self-report, observation)

[#sec-design]
=== Design

. *Experiment*
** Systematically manipulate (variables, thus change conditions) and conclude (causality, cause-effect variable relationship) to test a hypothesis.
** *In-/dependent variable*: The dependent variable (hypothesized to be affected), depend on the independent variable which will be manipulated.
*** Deliberate change some variables, while keeping all other variables constant.
** *Between-Subject Experiments*: (alias "between-groups") For each condition a separate group.
*** See: *DiMascio's* depression patients, where he used *random assignment* to avoid a bias.
** *Within-Subject Experiments*: (alias "repeated-measures") Each subject tested for each condition (multiple times).
. *Correlational Study*
** Only observe/measure relations of data, no manipulation.
** Limitation: No causation! => "_Correlation does not imply causality!_"
** See: link:/introduction/ch12-social_development/index.html#sec-baumrind_study[Baumrind's study] of parents' disciplinary styles and children's behavioral development.

image::images/correlational_study.jpg[Correlation between violent TV and aggressive behavior,400,100]

[arabic,start=3]
. *Descriptive Study*
** No correlation, no test.
** Characterize record.
** Sometimes use of numerical values.

.Descriptive study as done by Jane Goodall, who observed wild chimpanzees over a period of 30 years.
image::images/descriptive_study.jpg[Descriptive study of chimps by Jane Goodall,400,100]

=== Setting

. *Laboratory*
** Usually with experiments.
** Control of uniform environment.
** Better facilitated (equipment).
** Artificial environment might interfere.
. *Field* (opposite of lab)
** Usually with correlational studies.
** No control over conditions.
** Natural environment, "real-life" settings (home, work, school).
** Subjects most often unaware.

[#sec-data_collection]
=== Data-Collection

Each has its own pro & con, none can be said to be superior over the other.

. *Self-report*:
** Rate/describe own state/behavior.
** *Questionnaire*: Interview, dialogue, essay/binary, structured, self/others.
** *Introspection*: Subjective, not confirmable.
*** link:/people/wundt-wilhelm.html[Wilhelm Wundt] used this approach first.
*** Criticism about validity, nowadays better/more objective due to brain imaging.
. *Observational methods*:
** Observe and record only, no interfering.
*** Presence alone influences, thus keeping it here as small as possible.
** *Naturalistic Observation*
*** Observe subjects in their regular environment (home, work, school, shop).
*** See: link:/phenomena/hawthorne_effect.html[Hawthorne Effect] where the observation changed the result drastically (Habituation to the rescue).
** *Tests*
*** Problems/tasks given (gamification) for a (mental) problem to solve.

.Observing without interfering as much as possible, or better examine recorded videos.

[#sec-statistics]
== Statistics

.Nerd jokes never get boring, but one must first understand the theory.
image::images/standard_deviation_chickens.jpg[Standard deviation chickens,400,100]

=== Descriptive Statistics

* Summarizes set of data.
* Metrics:
** *Mean*: Arithmetic average, computing the sum of scores and dividing by number of scores.
** *Median*: Center/middle score, by ordering all numbers and pick the middle one, the one representing the "50th percentile".
*** Main advantage: It's robust against extremes.
** *Variability*: How much scores differ from one another and the mean.
** *Standard deviation*: Common measure of variability, how much scores differ from the mean.
** *Correlational Coefficient*: Indicating the strength/direction (positive/negative) of a relationship of two data-sets, ranging from -1.0 to +1.0.
*** Correlation of 0 means the two variables are not related at all.
*** Visually easily comprehensible via a *scatter plot*, where the data points lie nicely on a straight line.

.A scatter plot showing an example of a: A) moderate-positive B) strong-positive C) moderate-negative and D) uncorrelated correlation.
image::images/scatter_plot.jpg[Scatter Plot,400,100]

=== Inferential Statistics

* Gives *confidence* of gathered data, and the inferred conclusion based on it.
** Tries to reveal variability based on mere chance.
** Counteract uncontrollable, random variables.
** *Relationship*: Real and *repeatable* or just random?
* "_Law of Probability_": Chance, probability "p", level of significance.
* *Statistical Significance*:
** It's statistical significant if p < 0.05 (5%)
** Based on the following components:
... Effect size: Larger effect more likely to be significant
... Sample size: Large samples are less distorted by chance.
... Data variability: Within a group, greater variability indicates greater randomness.
** Differentiate between statistical and practical significance!
*** E.g. weight-loss drug, with high statistical significance to reduce weight by a few grams.

[#sec-biases]
== Biases

* Definition: A non-handled, non-random effect on a hypothesis.
* Avoidable by:
** Random assignments (avoid biased samples).
** Representative subjects (see below).
* Leads to false conclusion, and can't be detected by statistics.

=== Bias VS Random Variation

.Analogy with arrow shooting: 1) a beginner 2) an expert with a defect bow 3) a beginner with a defect bow
image::images/bias_error.jpg[Bias Error,200,100]

* Archer analogy above illustrates the difference:
** Target A shows the beginner, incapable of hitting the bullseye but in a consistent matter
** Target B shows a bias, the expert who consistently hits the wrong spot with a defect bow.
** Target C shows a combination of both, where the hits are consistently off considerably, a beginner with a defect bow.
* (Inferential) Statistics helps!

=== Expectancy

* Humans have wishes, and unintentionally influence outcome.
* *Subject-expectancy effect*
** Knowing being observed changes behavior.
** Believe in powers, placebo, link:/phenomena/hawthorne_effect.html[Hawthorne Effect]
** E.g. taking a drug leads to changes.
* *Observer-expectancy effect*:
** Also see the "Clever Hans" story above
** Example of "The Facilitated-Communication Debacle".
*** *Autistic people* had no language ability, couldn't express themselves verbally.
*** Facilitators were holding autistic people's hand for typing on a keyboard.
*** Autistic people seemed to be able to type meaningful statements.
*** The motivation to believe was huge, alone in US 100mio USD was spent for this.
*** Unfortunately it was the facilitators unconscious hand which was typing, not the autistic people themselves.
*** Sometimes leading to prosecutions due to claims of (false) sexual abuse (psychotherapy?).
*** Solved by showing a picture to the autistic person, but not to the facilitator.
*** They had no bad intentions, unconsciously they were deluded by the effect of their own expectations.
* Counteract expectancy effects by "*blinding*":
** Remove the knowledge of what is being then, thus remove expectations and influences.
** Observer as well as subject kept blind (if possible, which sometimes is not).
** *Double-blind studies*: Neither researcher nor subject know what's being done exactly.
** Use of placebos.

.Biased experiment with keyboard writing autism people: Who is typing?
image::images/bias_autism.jpg[Autism,200,100]

=== Reliability

* Indicating *repeatable* results. Measures errors, not bias.
** E.g. measuring thumb length two times yields *same result*.
* Variability "*p*".
* *Interobserver (interrater) Reliability*: Same observable by different researchers.
* *Operational Definition*: What exactly is the intention to measure.
* Also replicating earlier studies.
** Reproducing same experiments yields only 30% similar results.
*** Some yielded significant results by mere chance (5% chance).
** When context changes (way research is done), subtle differences can impact the result.
** Science is conservative, hesitant to novel findings.

=== Validity

* Valid means, it measures/predicts what is *intended to*.
* More critical than reliability, as source of bias.
* *Criterion Validity*: Check validity by correlating it with another (more direct) index.
* *Face Validity*: Procedure measures what it supposed to measure.

=== Samples

* Randomized: In order to prevent mere chance results.
** E.g. when subjects have a clear preference towards one option, there will be a biased sample.
** Hard to generalize to all of humanity.
* *Biased sample*: Sample not representative of the larger population.
* Between-group: See above.
* Avoid non-representative groups.
** E.g. Only WEIRD or college students.

.Most research is conducted with people from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic societies (WEIRD).
image::images/weird.jpg[WEIRD,200,100]

[#sec-ethics]
== Ethics

=== Humans

* *Informed consent*: Know what's about to happen, including risks, beforehand.
* *Privacy*: Subjects may hold information back, and ensure their anonymity.
* *Minimum discomfort/harm*: Harm outweighs the benefits.
* *Can quit*: Subject can quit at any given time.
* *Deception*: Controversial, as sometimes needed ("white lies").
* *Debriefing*: Inform about result/findings. Reveal any deceptions.

=== Animals

* Things that would be unethical to humans, can be done to animals sometimes.
** *Surgeries*: Implant diodes, use chemicals to impair brain.
** *Breeding*: Artificial selection.
* *Minimal suffering*: And well cared.
* *Balance*: Suffering and benefit.
* *Applicability*: Must be possible to apply to humans (reduce our suffering).

Has already helped considerably to reduce human suffering, thanks mostly to rats and pigeons.
Experiments with chimpanzees, our closest genetic relatives, have been banned as they are a endangered species.

=== Principles

* APA has rules, which must be followed in order to be published in journals.
* Laws: Must follow in order to receive funding (ethics review panels).
* Much of past experiments would have not been possible today anymore.

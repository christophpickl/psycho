//* pavlovl won nobel prize; salivation of dogs
//* classical=pavlovian, operant=instrumental (next to observational learning)
//* classical/pavlovian (stimulus, passive), operant/instrumental (behavior, active)
//* first thorndike, then skinner
//* "much like the laws of gravity, the laws of learning are always in effect"
//* law of effect: more likely to happen if rewarded (obvious common sense ;)
//* taste aversion conditioning: flavor associated with discomfort, thus avoided/disliked. clinical application: people avoid food eaten before chemotherapy
//* conditioned compensatory responses: e.g. cue for drug, body prepares

== Keywords

- *Foo*: Bar

== Keypeople

* Ivan Pavlov
* Thorndike
* Skinner
// TODO people from contemporary experiments

== Classical Conditioning

* Terminology/abbreviations:
** US ... Unconditioned Stimulus
** CS ... Conditioned Stimulus
** UR ... Unconditioned Response
** CR ... Conditioned Response


* Procedure
** UR: Food => Saliva
** Pairing:
*** Neutral stimulus: Bell
*** US: Food
** Neutral stimulus becomes CS
*** Bell => Saliva
* Extinction
** Different neurons
*** Inhibiting
*** Promoting
** Suppression
*** Not unlearned
** Spontaenous recovery
** CS without US
*** Bell without food
*** => CR stops
* Generalization
** Similar stimulus
*** E.g. black VS grey rectangle
** Discrimination
*** "Reduced generalization" (more precise)
*** US => CS
*** Similar stimulus => Nothing
* Learned what?
** S-R
*** CS => CR
** S-S
*** CS => US
** Best if reliable
* Emotion, motivation
** Prepare for important event
** Fear
// TODO link to experiment
*** Little albert
** Hunger
*** Appetizer effect
** Liking
*** Evaluative conditioning
** Sexual arousal
* Drugs
** Pairing
*** Stimulus = drug
** Opposite effect
*** Drug relapse
*** Drug tolerance
**** Compensatory effect

== Operant Conditioning

=== Behavior

* Thorndike & Skinner
** With/Without awareness
** Operant response
*** Action => Effect
*** Law of Effect
**** Thorndike's Puzzle Box
*** Reinforcer
**** Skinner
**** Increases frequency
* Availability variations
** Shaping
*** Successive approximation
** Extinction
*** Not reinforced
*** Decline response
** Schedules
*** Partial
*** Continuous
*** Affects
**** Response rate
**** Extinction resistance
* Reinforce VS punish
** +/- response rate
** Positive VS negative
*** Adding/removing stimulus
*** Reinforce: Praise / Stop noise
*** Punish: Beat / Deny rights

=== Conditions & Consequences

* Discrimination training
** Only specific stimulus
* Concept understanding
** Generalization
** Similar to discriminated stimulus
** Identify learned concepts
* Overjustification
** Pos./Neg. reward
*** Conditioning
*** Meaning
** Unneeded Extra
*** Behavior declines
* Behavior analysis
** Token economy
*** Artificial reinforcer
*** Target behavior
*** With retarded people
** Autism
*** See: Lovaas
*** Effective
*** Individual differences
** Manage classroom

== Beyond Conventional Learning

* Food
** Food-avoidance
** Avoid poisenous
** Different than classical conditioning
** Prefer "good"
*** Healthy
*** Nutritional
** Prenatal preferences
* Fear
** Evolutionary preparation
*** Threats
*** Real/fake snakes
** Fearful voice
*** More attentive
* Mother imprinting
** Ducks follow
*** Critical period
*** First moving object
** Maternal call
*** Adaptive behavior
*** Prenatal conditioning
* Sexual imprinting
** Early childhood experiences
** Mate preferences
** Westermarck effect
*** Incest aversion
*** Cohabitation

== Special Learning

* Social Learning
** Albert Bandura
*** "Social Cognitive"
*** Vicarious Reinforcement
** Observational Learning
*** Stimulus enhancement
*** Goal enhancement
*** Emulation
** Teaching
*** Most sophisticated
*** Mostly only humans
* Exploration
** Primitive play
*** More species
*** All ages
** Learn environment
** Balance: Curiosity and fear
** Latent learning
*** Without reward
*** Useful knowledge
* Play
** Karl Groos
*** Develop survival skills
*** Species most where needed
** Humans
*** Also cultural
** Children development
*** Language
*** Perspective taking
*** Executive functions

= Attraction and Relationships

* Many of our assumptions about attraction/falling in love are false.
** E.g. the belief that opposites attract, instead similarity is a stronger predictor of who we're drawn to.
** E.g. that women are pickier than men, which is often true, but not for the reasons we think.

== What's predicting it?

* How we decide who we like and want to get to know better?
* Making friends and warm relationships makes us most happy.
** The absence of meaningful relationships makes us feel lonely, worthless, hopeless, helpless, and powerless.
* "Self-expansion" is a central human motivation: The desire to overlap/blend with another person.
** This allows us to access another person's knowledge, insights, and experience; broadening/deepen our own experience of life.

=== Propinquity Effect

* A.k.a. "The person next door"-effect.
* The simplest determinants of interpersonal attraction is propinquity (=proximity).
** Close friendships are often made in schools because of the prolonged propinquity.

.Propinquity Effect
****
The more we see/interact someone, the more likely they become friends/lovers.
****

* Or put differently, the propinquity effect = positive relation between proximity and attraction.
** Not only physical distance, but also "functional distance": based on architecture/location, with whom we cross paths most often.
** A researcher showed Chinese characters to Westeners, and they guessed a more positive meaning if they have seen it more often.
** Advertising is all about product placement and commercial jingles; the more consumers see/hear it, the more they will like it (and spend money on the product).
** Students sitting in a classroom without interacting with anyone; after 5/10/15 times being there, others were asked to rate faces; the higher showed up, the better rated.
** Not only physical attractiveness/romantic attraction, but also facilitates prejudice reduction.

.Mere Exposure Effect
****
The more exposure to a stimulus, the more we will like it.
****

* Propinquity works because of familiarity.
** We associate positive feelings with what is familiar to us: comfort food, songs from childhood, corporate logos.
** Same for people: The more often we see them, the more familiar, the more friendship blooms.
** Yet, if the person is obnoxious (=unausstehlich), the more exposure, the more dislike.

=== Similarity

* Similarity is often the fuel in relationships: match in interests, attitudes, values, background, or personality.
* Folk wisdom captures that: "Birds of a feather flock together".
** Contradictory advice "opposites attract" (concept of complementary) is not true, as shown by research evidence.
* Similar in opinions/personality, in demographics (same rural background) or in attitudes/values (political views).
* Similar in interests and experiences:
** Situations chose to be in, other people chose them for similar reasons.
** We will find in certain social situations already similar other people.
** Also: Shared experiences promote attraction.
* We are drawn to people who look like us (are similar in appearance).
** E.g. experiment (physical similarity and seating choice) shown that people with same features (wearing glasses, hair color) would seat closer next to each other than random chance would predict.
* Genetics: Friends tend to have more similar DNA than do strangers.
** Genetically similar people (predispositions) end up doing the same thing/time/place.
* We need to differentiate between _actual_ and _perceived_ similarity.
** In long-term relationships, our belief in similarity was a better predictor than actual similarity.
** Thus: _Feeling_ similar is what's really important, even when those similarities don't exist.
* We value different characteristics whether we are looking for something long- or short-term.
** For hook-ups we also choose people who are very different from us; an adventure.
* Playing hard-to-get can backfire: It might increase wanting, but also decreases liking.

*Young People's Hook-up Culture*

Today's teenagers have an unprecedented level of casual, quick, and commitment-free sexual encounters with regularly rotating number of new partners, which stands in stark contrast to more traditional ideas of courtship, dating, and relationships of the past.
It sounds compelling, but is it true? Recent research suggests that this may be more a myth than reality. Let's start with the term "hook-up": One-half had genitals involved, and one-fourth sexual intercourse. Half hook-ups was with a familiar, repeat partner. So they are not at all those one-time sex with first-time partners we might think.
Some US survey indicated that in the 90s about 49% of young adults had two or fewer sex partners since the age of 18. Around 2010 that rate stayed unchanged at around 51%.
The idea around a hook-up culture illustrates how expectations and common sense assumptions about human sexuality do not always align with scientific data and real behavior.
====

=== Reciprocal Liking

* We like to be liked -fullstop.
** Yet "a man can do what he wants, but not want what he wants" as Schopenhauer put it. ("Der Mensch kann zwar tun, was er will, aber er kann nicht wollen, was er will.")
* Knowing that a person likes us, fuels our attraction to that person.
** Liking can even make up for the absence of similarity, so powerful is it.
** Men would show liking towards a woman expressing interest (eye contact, leaning forward, listening attentively), although they knew she disagreed on important issues with them.
** Whether there are verbal or non-verbal clues, the most crucial determinant of whether we like a person is to which we _believe_ that person likes us.
* Pretty faces are like magnets: We like to look longer at them. But:
** That bias to stare a bit longer at attractive faces can be broken with love.
** Participants in an experiment were asked to imagine a crush would also have feelings for them. This would disrupt our otherwise default focus (on alternatives out there).
** If our attention was constantly hijacked by _every_ pretty face, we could never turn initial interactions into meaningful ones, and sustained romantic relationships.
* With the glow of reciprocated liking, we stop having a wandering eye, at least for a while, convincing us that the grass may not be greener on the other side.

=== Physical Attractiveness

* Pretty faces, propinquity, similarity, and reciprocal liking are not the only predictors. What about first impressions?
* It's not your partner's intelligence/independence/sensitivity/sincerity, the overriding determinant was physical attractiveness.
** This is shown by our chronic tendency to shift visual attention to attractive others in our immediate vicinity.
* Some studies show that there is no great difference between men and women, others show that men value it a bit more.
** It may be, that man _say_ that physical attractiveness matters more, but when it comes to actual behavior, men and women are fairly similar in this regard.
* It is also the single-most important trigger for sexual desire; men, women, hetero- and homosexuals.

==== What is attractive?

* In American culture, media tells us that beauty is associated with goodness.
** Disney movies show us that the female protagonist have small, pert noses, big eyes, shapely lips, blemish-free complexions, and have slim, athletic bodies; often rather like Barbie dolls.
* We are bombarded with media depictions of attractiveness, which then creates a standard of beauty, often represented by models.
* These features can be measured, which results in:
** Female beauty: large eyes, small nose, small chin, prominent cheekbones, high eyebrows, large pupils, big smile.
** Male beauty: large eyes, prominent cheekbones, large chin, big smile.

==== Cultural Standards of Beauty

* Our perception of beauty is similar across cultures.
** They only vary in specific facial features, yet we agree mostly on what is physical attractive in the human face.
* Via evolution, we would explain that symmetry (of size, shape, location) is a marker for good health and reproductive fitness, having "good genes".
** Even infants prefer the same photographs as adults do.
* When using pictures of different people, and merge/morphed (via computing mathematical averages), the resulting merged picture is judged as more attractive.
** The averaged composite face lost some of the atypical/asymmetrical variation.

==== The Power of Familiarity

* We also prefer faces that resemble our own.
** In an experiment, people would give higher ratings for an "opposite-sex clone" (picture of themselves morphed onto opposite sex face).
* We prefer the comfortable, familiar, ad safe; over the unknown and unfamiliar.
** Familiarity thus underlies other concepts of propinquity (see frequently/mere exposure, become familiar), similarity (are similar, feel familiar), and reciprocal liking (we like each other, we become familiar).

==== Assumptions about Attractive People

* Beauty matters to us, even when it shouldn't.
** We are attracted to beauty, leading to inequity in everyday life.
* The unfair benefit of beauty:
** It seemed that prettier babies were healthier, quicker gained weight, etc. Turned out, the nurses respond more to prettier infants, and gave them better care.
** Good-looking people earn 15% more.
** Professors get higher student evaluation ratings who are perceived as more attractive.
** It even helps to win elections! Attractiveness being the best predictor (a bit more for women than for men).

.Halo Effect
****
We assume a person with one positive characteristic, also has other (unrelated) positive characteristics.
****

* Simply put, the Halo effect is about: "What is beautiful, is good".
** Physical attractiveness has its largest effect in relation to social competence: Beautiful people are thought to be more sociable, extroverted, assertive, sexual, and popular.
*** Interestingly, there is some empirical support for that: Highly attractive people _do_ actually develop good social interaction skills.
*** That all might be due to a self-fulfilling prophecy: Beautiful people receive more attention, helping them to develop better social skills.
** When research participants had to do a phone-call, when told the other-sex person was attractive, they spoke in such a way that would bring out her/his most sparkling qualities (applied to men and women alike).
* It seems this happens also cross culturally.
** Individualistic cultures, who value independence, individuality, self-reliance, the beautiful stereotype included traits of personal strength.
** Collectivistic cultures value harmonious group relations, so the beautiful stereotype included integrity and concern for others.
** Stereotypical traits shared by several countries:
*** America, Canada, Korea: sociable, extraverted, likable, happy, popular, well-adjusted, friendly, mature, poised, sexually warm/responsive
*** Additional American/Canadian traits: strong, assertive, dominant
*** Additional Korean traits: sensitive, empathic, generous, honest, trustworthy
* See more link:../../phenomena/halo_effect.html[details about the Halo effect] and how this cognitive bias changes our perception in a dedicated subpage.

=== Evolution and Mate Selection

* Why do we love who we love? Is it purely evolutionary "fitness", measured by reproductive success.
** Reproductive success is not just part of the game; it _is_ the game!
** As can be seen how evolutionary psychology explains social behavior in terms of genetic factors and natural selection.

==== Evolution and Sex Differences

* Evolutionary psychology makes some interesting (and controversial) predictions regarding sex differences in mate preference, based on the investment theory:
** For females, reproduction is costly (time, energy, effort), plus the discomfort/risk of pregnancy, and upbringing until maturity.
*** It's serious business for them, so they have to consider carefully when and with whom to reproduce.
** For males on the other hand, reproduction is a low-cost, short-term investment.
* Throughout the world, male's reproductive success is measured by offspring _quantity_.
** Female's success lies in successfully raising each offspring to maturity; thus they pair less often and only with carefully chosen males, because of the high costs.
* We find attractive based on external cues in the opposite sex.
** Women look for a man with resources, who can support raising a child (economic, career achievements).
*** They value ambition, industriousness, earning capacity.
*** Near ovulation/peak fertility, women rate men more attractive who have a masculine face (sharp, pronounced jawline), muscular physique, and a symmetrical face.
** Men look for a woman who appears capable of reproducing successfully: Physical appearance/attractiveness, age and health.
** On the top of this list though, both value the same: honesty, trustworthiness, pleasant personality.

==== Alternate Perspectives on Sex Differences

* One could argue that the advantages of having multiple sex partners should also apply to women.
** It increases the odds of getting resources for the offspring, and benefits the genetic diversity.
** Women could choose one guy for "good genes" and the other to raise the offspring.
* One could argue men value physical attractiveness not because of evolved tendencies, but because being taught by society.
** Men have been conditioned by decades of advertising, media images and other cultural messages to prioritize beauty.
** Also conditioned to have a more recreational approach to sex (than women do).
* Some research has found that women value physical attractiveness just as much as men; especial considering a potential sexual partner (opposed to a marriage partner).
* Around the world, women have less power, status, wealth and other resources; thus they rely on men for economic security.
** The more economic power women have in a culture, the more highly they prioritize a man's physical attractiveness.
* It is very difficult to disentangle "nature" (inborn preferences) from "nurture" (cultural norms and gender roles).
* Whether looking at online dating, speed-dating, ... women are significantly more discriminating.
** Reason being, that women have to be picky, is because their fertility window is relatively narrow.
** Yet, when tweaking speed dating, that men staid seated, and women had to rotate, to approach, women were not pickier than men anymore.
*** Women reported more chemistry with men, and wanted to see more men again.
** Being approached gives you control, feeling in demand and having options.
* As so often: We need both, nature and nurture in order to understand (the psychology of attraction and mate selection).

== Connections in the Digital World

* How technologies shape attraction and social connections.
** They might be amazing and offer amazing opportunities, but they also impair our feelings of social connectedness/social cost.
** Having merely a device (mobile phone, laptop, tablet) present during a conversation, and the ratings of connectedness/empathy lowers significantly (also trust, and closeness).
** There is a causal link between presence of a device and decreased social connection.
* A time-traveler from 2000 would barely recognize today's world.
** It's not unusual seeing people in a restaurant, with their faces/thumbs buried in their devices, taking pictures of their food.
* Our advice: Unplug once in a while, take periodic vacations from technology.

=== Attraction 2.0

* Mate preference in an online era.
** How does the internet age change aspects like: propinquity, similarity, familiarity?
* Propinquity: When physical distance no longer create the same obstacles they once did.
* Similarity: Still the same, we are attracted those with similar appearance, to "play in the same league".
** We select (and be selected by) people with similar levels of popularity; we try to "match up" with those of comparable popularity (applies to men and women).
* Familiarity: We often are not 100% accurate in our online dating profiles, and once a meeting in real life happens, those little lies will make a successful relationship less likely.

=== Promise and Pitfalls

* Dating apps are on an all-time high (with a peak during the COVID19 pandemic).
** Attitudes have never been more positive about them.
* They advertise 3 primary services: 1) large number of profiles 2) opportunity to communicate with them 3) matching based on compatibility analysis (mathematical algorithm).
* Yet, the compatibility analysis doesn't really work all the time:
** We are not always accurate predicting the mate characteristics which will lead us to a satisfying relationship
** The algorithms focus on personality traits or other stable characteristics.
** Best predictors for relationship satisfaction (like communication style and sexual compatibility) can't be assessed until getting to know each other.
** And as stated already above: we are not always accurate ourselves in our dating profiles (about 80% do so; mostly weight, age, height, with no gender difference).
*** These are intentional efforts to "stretch the truth" a bit, as self-reported estimates are good predictors of actual accuracy.
*** WIth pictures though, more unconscious distortion is happening, especially among women; making themselves thinner, having more hair, photos being retouched/airbrushed.
* Tips about deceptive profiles:
** Use of fewer first-person pronouns ("I" and "me"); those who lie distance themselves psychologically from their half-truths.
** Use of negations/negative turns of phrase ("not judgmental" instead of "open-minded", "not averse to taking risks" instead of "adventurous").
** Use of fewer total words, as stretching the truth is hard work and cognitively demanding.

== Love and Close Relationships

* Let's examine cultural, personality, and biological factors (associated with different types of love).
* Suppose you want a woman to like you; you should first hang out with her, to become familiar, emphasize similarity, tell her you enjoy her company.
** This is what social psychologist mostly focused on: first impressions (and less how to have close friendships or romantic relationships).
* Psychologists face a daunting task when it comes to complex feelings as love and passion.

=== Defining Love

* In defining love, we generally distinguish between companionate love and passionate love.

.Companionship Love
****
Feelings of intimacy/affection for a person, _not_ accompanied by passion/physiological arousal.
****

* E.g. in nonsexual close friendships, or in romantic relationships were there is intimacy but no more heat and passion as there used to be.

.Passionate Love
****
Intense longing for a person, accompanied by physiological arousal.
****

* Physiological arousal such as shortness of breath and a thumping heart when they are around.
** If love is not unrequited (=not answered/returned), feeling great sadness and despair.
* Measure passionate love: strong/uncontrollable thoughts, intense feelings, overt (=offenkundig) acts towards that person

[NOTE.tryit,caption=TRY IT]
====
*Passionate Love Scale*

Think of the person you love most passionately. In the blank, fill in that person's name, and give each item a number between 1 (not at all true) and 10 (definitely true).

. I would feel deep despair if _ left me.
. Sometimes I feel I can't control my thoughts; they are obsessively on _.
. I feel happy when I am doing something to make _ happy.
. I would rather be with _ than anyone else.
. I'd get jealous if I thought _ were falling in love with someone else.
. I yearn to know all about _.
. I want _ - physically, emotionally, mentally.
. I have an endless appetite for affection from _.
. For me, _ is the perfect romantic partner.
. I sense my body responding when _ touches me.

. I want _ to know me - my thoughts, my fears, and my hopes.
. I eagerly look for signs indicating _'s desire for me.
. I possess a powerful attraction for _.
. I get extremely depressed when things don't go right in my relationship with _.

_Scoring_: The range can be between 15 and 135, the higher, the more passionate in love you are.

.Sternberg's Triangular Theory of Love
image::images/sternberg.png[sternberg,400,100]

* This _triangular theory_ from Sternberg tries to capture different types of love in a theoretical model.
** It proposes three major components to love: intimacy (feeling close/connected), passion (physical attraction, sex-drive), and commitment over time.

=== Culture and Love

* Although we all experience love, it is differently defined across cultures ().
* Also, the process of finding a partner varies.
** In Nepal, dating is forbidden, even casual meetings between young men and women are inappropriate.
** A future spouse is chosen by one's parents via arranged marriages; social standing (family, caste, economic resources) being the most important factor.
** The couple speaks for the first time often on their wedding day.
** Nevertheless, they turn out to be successful, compared with western high divorce rate.
* Love in marriage is only important in individualistic, not in collectivistic societies.
** West: we immerse into the new partner, ignoring friends/family; decision who to marry is personal.
** East: Choice considers the family's wishes.
** Western ways have recently started to permeated collectivistic cultures.
* Western couples value passionated love more than Eastern, they value companionate love more.
** In Africa (Kenya) they value both equally.
* Anthropological research of 166 societies showed that 147 of them had passionate love.
* We all love, but not necessarily (describe it) the same way.
** Japanese word "amae" is an extremely positive state, becoming a total passive love object, indulged and taken care of by one's romantic partner, like a mother-infant relationship.
*** No real equivalent word, but something meaning like "dependency"; something we consider as unhealthy.
** Chinese "gan qing" is helping/working for another person.
** In Korea, they use "jung" to describe what ties two people together, a strong connection, which takes time and mutual experiences.
* Romantic love is (nearly) universal, yet cultural rules alter how that emotional state is experienced, expressed, and remembered.

=== Attachment Styles

* The way we think/experience love is shaped by the relationship to our caregivers.
** What we learn as infants, we use as a schema for all relationships (generalized!) throughout life.
* Developed by link:../../people/bowlby-john.html[John Bowlby] and link:../../people/ainsworth-mary.html[Mary Ainsworth].
* Strange Situation experiment:
** Caregiver (mother) briefly left infant in an unfamiliar room with an unfamiliar person/stranger before returning.
** The infant's reaction was observed upon separation and reunion.
** Secure: Infant would cry, showing signs of distress when leaving; happy when returning; they trust not worried about abandonment.
** Avoidant: No reaction when leaving; desire to be close, but suppress this need, thinking attempts will be rejected (by distant/busy caregiver).
** Anxious/ambivalent: Distressed even before leaving; difficult to soothe when returning; response with mix of anger/indifference.

.Attachment Styles
****
Expectations about relationships, based on relationship with caregiver when young.
****

.Secure Attachment Style
****
Trust, no fear of abandoned, one's worthy and well liked.

56% of the people - "I find it easy to get close to others, feel comfortable depending on them and them depending on me. I don't often worry about being abandoned or getting too close."
****

.Avoidant Attachment Style
****
Difficulties in intimate relationships because previous attempts rebuffed.

25% of the people - "I'm uncomfortable being close to others. Difficulties trusting them completely, depending on them. Nervous when someone gets close. Others want me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable with."
****

.Anxious/Ambivalent Attachment Style
****
Concern and high anxiety that others won't reciprocate one's desire for intimacy.

19% of the people - "Others are reluctant getting as close as I want them to be. I worry my partner doesn't love me/won't stay with me. I want to completely merge with the other, and that scares them away."
****

* How attachment style affect our romantic relationships:
** Securely attached people have the most enduring romantic relationships of all.
** Anxious/ambivalent most short-lived. They enter most quickly, even before knowing their partner well.
*** Most upset and angriest when love is not reciprocated.
** Avoidant: least likely to enter a relationship; report never been in a love; emotional distant.
* It is although not the case that we are doomed that we have the same relationship experience forever, with everyone!
** 30% of the people change attachment styles within years.
** Based on experiences in relationship, we can change; learning new ways of relating.
** We also respond to situational variables, displaying more/less secure attachment style in one or the other relationship.

=== Body and Brain in Love

* Heart racing, quickened breath, feeling alert and full of energy.
* Yet, sometimes the physiological arousal is a cause, rather than effect, of our attraction to others.
* We have the tendency to transfer feelings of physiological arousal to romantic feelings.
* Imagine being on a roller coaster with a stranger, an attractive opposite-sex person.
** Experiments have shown that there is a bidirectional relationship between arousal and love.
* While people looked at pictures of their partners under an fMRI, some brain regions (VTA, ventral tegmental area, and the caudate nucleus) showed greater activation.
** VTA gets activated in rewarding behaviors, such as ingesting cocaine, which leads to: pleasure, euphoria, restlessness, sleeplessness, loss of appetite; similar to love.
** VTA is rich in dopamine, and also fires when eating chocolate.
** These two regions are major reward/motivation centers.
** Also for gambles these regions get highly activated.
** Love is addictive, like a drug, and dopmaine-rich associated with pleasure, reward, and motivation.

== Assessing Relationships

* How to measure satisfaction and researching romantic breakups.
** How do we assess how our relationship is going?
** What factors shape whether we are happy with our "love life"?
** What determines whether we remain committed, or start considering alternatives?
** What are the psychological consequences of breaking up?

=== Theories of Relationship Satisfaction

==== Social Exchange Theory

* Attraction can be though tof an example of social reward.
** It is pleasing to have our attitudes validated; the more similar, the more rewarded spending time together.
** We also prefer to be around someone who likes us; especially when that person is physically attractive.
* The more social reward (fewer costs) the more we like that person.
** Other side: If costs (emotional turmoil) are higher than rewards (validation, praise), it will not last.
* This lead to an economic model of costs and benefits: The Social Exchange Theory.
** In essence, we "buy" the best relationship we can get; one that gives us the most value for our emotional money based on the available options.
** We feel rewarded engaging in a relationship; the characteristics/behaviors of our partner, the ability to acquire external resources (money, status, activities, interesting people).
*** In Brazil, friendship is openly used as an exchange value; they need "pistolão" (a big, powerful handgun): use a person to get to personal connections to help them to get what they want.
** Friendships and romantic relationships have some costs; putting up with those annoying habits and characteristics.

.Social Exchange Theory
****
Our feeling about relationships depend on: Rewards/costs, what we deserve, and chances for someone better.
****

* Next to using rewards/costs to calculate how satisfied we are in a relationship, we use our comparison level; what we expect to get out of it in terms of costs/rewards.
** Higher comparison level, expecting lots of rewards, and few costs.
** People with a lower comparison level, would be happier in the same relationship, because expect the relationship to be difficult and costly.

.Comparison Level
****
Our expectations about rewards/costs we receive in a relationship.
****

* Relationship satisfaction also depends on your perception of how likely you could replace it with something better.
** As the saying goes: There are plenty of fish in the sea.
* People with a low comparison level for alternatives, are more likely to stay in a costly relationship.
** It doesn't seem great to them, but better than what else is out there.

.Comparison Level for Alternatives
****
Our expectations about rewards/costs we would get in an alternative relationship.
****

* There is lots of empirical support for the social exchange theory.
** We all (friends and couples) pay attention to costs and rewards in our relationships, and those perceptions predict how we feel about the relationship status.
* Yet another factor needs to be considered: How much we have put already in a relationship.
** Tangible things like: financial resources, possessions, and property.
** Intangible things like: emotional welfare of children, time and emotional energy spent building the relationship, and personal integrity which would get lost if divorced.
** The greater the investment, the less likely the breakup, even if satisfaction is low and alternatives look promising.

.Investment Model
****
Our commitment depends on how much we have invested, what would be lost if ending the relationship.
****

* In summary three factors will predict whether an intimate relationship works or not (=commitment):
.. how *satisfied* we are (comparing costs and rewards; expectation)
.. what we think of our *alternatives*
.. how great our *investment* is

==== Equity Theory

* Equity, also meaning: fairness.
** But not fairness as in the way we play board games, that's not how we engage in relationships.
** We aren't just concerned about getting the most reward for the least cost...
** We are also concerned about the rewards/costs of the other.

.Equity Theory
****
We are happiest when both our rewards and costs are equal.
****

* If this is the case, our relationships are the happiest and most stable.
* For the underbenefited this makes sense; no one wants to be miserable/unappreciated.
** And for the overbenefited? Our social norm makes us feel uncomfortable/guilty, to get more than we deserve.
* In intimate relationship we're trading "fuzzy types of resources" (not just notebook for lunch invite), keeping track of balance is thus difficult.
* It seems there is a "looser give-and-take" (you forgot birthday, thus inviting for dinner) instead of rigid tit-for-tat strategy.
* New acquaintances are governed by equity concerns, and thus are called: Exchange Relationships.
** Here, people keep track of who is contributing what, and feel taken advantage if put in more than getting out.

.Exchange Relationships
****
Relationships governed by need for equity (equal ratio of rewards/costs).
****

* Longer-term relationships (close friends, family members, romantic partners) are governed by the desire to help each other in need: Communal Relationships.
** We respond to each other's needs, regardless whether we get "paid back".

.Communal Relationships
****
Relationships governed by the desire to respond to the other person's need.
****

* Homosexuals report greater compatibility, and have fewer conflicts than heterosexual couples.
* In communal relationships, partners are more relaxed about what constitutes equity.
** Believe: Things will eventually balance out over the long run.

In short:

* Exchange relationships governed by equity concerns:
** want to be repaid for our favors; otherwise feel exploited
** keeping track who is contributing what
** ability to help, no effect on our mood
* Communal relationships governed by needs of other's:
** don't like to be repaid; don't feel exploited otherwise
** don't keep track of contributions
** helping the other puts us in a good mood

=== Breaking up

* The process and experience of it.
** Divorces happen often after 3-4 years (research from Dr. Helen Fisher tells us in: "Anatomy of love").
** Breaking up is one of life's most painful experiences; thus we develop different disengagement strategies.
* Relationship dissolution is not a single event, but a process with 4 steps (see list below).
** Intrapersonal: We think a lot about our relationship dissatisfaction.
** Dyadic: Discussing the breakup with the partner.
** Social: Announcing breaking to others.
** Intrapersonal: Recover form breakup, doing a retrospective.
** The reasons/story of the breakup differs very much between close friends and coworkers/neighbours.
* Why do relationships end? Four types of behavior (two destructive/constructive behaviors):
.. Actively harming (abuse, threat)
.. Passively allow deterioration (avoidance, ignorance, no effort)
.. Actively trying to improve (talk, change, seek support)
.. Passively remaining loyal
* In 30% of the cases, the things we liked initially most about our partner, will be the very reason we break up.
** Statements like: "He is so unusual and different" becomes "He and I have nothing in common". Or "She is so exciting and unpredictable" becomes "I can never count on her".
** This should remind us of the importance *similarities* in relationships.
* Men and women end romantic relationships same amount of time -not true what some might believe that women break up more often.
* All relationships experience conflicts, not all deal with it the same (un/healthy) way.
** Better chances with:
... Wait to calm down, before jumping into disagreements.
... Listening without automatically getting defensive.
* Remaining friends afterward is more likely with higher rates of satisfaction and investment.
** Sometimes it can be stressful if people keep track of their exes activities/new partners. Better to totally disconnect then, to get some peace back.
* Three main themes for women's emotional reaction after a break-up: 1) shame/guilt 2) failure 3) isolation and loneliness.

==== Steps in Dissolving Close Relationships

Dissatisfaction with the relationship:

. Intrapersonal phase: "I can't stand this anymore"
** Focus on / asses adequacy of partner's behavior
** Evaluate negative aspects of relationship
** Consider costs of withdrawal
** Assess positive aspects of alternative relationships
** Dilemma: Express/repress my thoughts
. Dyadic phase: "I'd be justified in withdrawing"
** Dilemma: "confront/avoid the issue"
** Confront partner
** Negotiate/discuss "our relationship"
** Attempt to repair, reconciliation
** Asses costs of withdrawal/reduced intimacy
. Social phase: "I mean it"

= Self-test Social Cognition

[#test1]
== 1. Low-Effort (Automatic) Thinking

. Function of schemas.
.. They usually give erroneous judgements because of the self-fulfilling prophecy.
.. Always beneficial, organize world, fill in knowledge gaps.
.. Useful to organize information, problematic when resulting in self-fulfilling prophecy.
.. Organize information about others, but not events (such as eating in a restaurant).
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#
. How does a schema _not_ become available?
.. The more negative the content, the more likely accessible.
.. Due to past experiences.
.. Temporarily due to priming.
.. Related to current goals.
** [hiddenAnswer]#a.#
. Example of self-fulfilling prophecy?
.. Husband not as helpful as friends', but does help with household chores.

** [hiddenAnswer]#b.#
. Two groups in research have to identify colors and memorize (different) list of words. Both then read the same about a fictional character. One forms positive, the other negative impression; why?
.. Priming with different words activated relevant schemas.
.. Both groups were exposed to different information about the character.
.. Availability heuristic used by one group.

== 2. Automatic Thinking Types

. What's "automatic goal pursuit"?
.. We select goals only by controlled thinking.
.. We often select goals recently primed, without realizing it.
.. We often select goals which were primed, but only if we are consciously aware of it.
.. We never select our goals consciously; they are only automatically primed.
** [hiddenAnswer]#b.#

.. Availability h.
.. Representativeness h.
.. Anchoring and adjustment h.

** [hiddenAnswer]#b.#
. Ask people for 7 / 14 instances where they were brave. What happens?
.. The 7-group thinks more brave than 14-group.
.. No differences.
.. Both rate less brave than control group.
.. The 14-group thinks less brave than 7-group.
** [hiddenAnswer]#a. and d. (semantically identical answers)#
. Why do people believe horoscopes are accurate descriptions?
.. They are written vaguely, so people view them as representative.
.. They trigger automatic decision making.
.. People find it difficult to bring examples to mind which are similar to the horoscope.
.. They automatically prime people's life goals.

** [hiddenAnswer]#a.#
. Analytic thinking style.
.. Focus context, and object relation.
.. Focus properties without context.

== 4. High-Effort (Controlled) Thinking

** [hiddenAnswer]#? (none?!)#

.. Promising new way to let impaired people communicate.
.. Facilitators were deliberately faking answers.

** [hiddenAnswer]#?#
. Best analogy for thinking abilities?
.. Cognitive misers
.. Motivated tacticians
.. Skilled detectives

[#test5]
== 5. Test Yourself

. Research on automatic thinking
.. Vital for survival, but imperfect, mistaken judgements with consequences
.. Super accurate, rarely errors
.. Usually errors
.. Best when done consciously
** [hiddenAnswer]#a.#
. Car drivers runs a red light. Person A judges as reckless, B as "in an emergency". Why interpreted differently?
.. A uses controlled thinking, B not
.. They have different personalities
.. A is liberal, B is conservative
.. Different schemas accessible, via recent experiences that primed different schemas
** [hiddenAnswer]#d.#
. Use of schemas
.. An example of controlled thinking
.. When incorrect schema, rarely act to make it come true
.. Can be erroneous, still useful to organize info, and filling gaps
.. Schema choice influenced only what is chronically accessible; not goals or primed
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#
. You believe Brits are unfriendly. You meet one at a party and act unpleasant toward him. He in turn acts cold and hostile to you.
.. Analytic thinking
.. Representativeness heuristic
.. Cognitive dissonance
.. Self-fulfilling prophecy
** [hiddenAnswer]#d.#
. Deciding whether friendly or not, base judgment on remember number of smiles received.
.. Representativeness heuristic
.. Availability heuristic
.. Framing effect
.. Counterfactual reasoning
** [hiddenAnswer]#b.#
. What's least automatic thinking?
.. Acting according primed goals
.. Use body metaphors to judge
.. Counterfactual reasoning
.. Self-fulfilling prophecy
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#
. You usually go to store A, but today decide to go to store B. You get robbed and think "If only I had not gone there". Why thoughts like this?
.. Expected positive events that day
.. Store B is unusual
.. Initially wanted to go to store A
.. Both b. and c.
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#
. Research on controlled thinking and free will shows:
.. Disconnect between conscious about motivations and what's really going on
.. Doesn't matter whether believe in it or not
.. Primate have same free will as humans
.. We definitely have no free will
** [hiddenAnswer]#a.#
. You are being told a guy is a mechanic. Then watch a video where he says stereotypical things about professors and then also about mechanics. Schema theory would say you will remember more of:
.. later things (than initial)
.. initial things (than later)
.. mechanic-related things (than professor)
.. professor-related things (than mechanic)
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#
. Conclusion about social cognition
.. Better only use controlled thinking
.. We are amazing at it, but room for improvement
.. Same in all cultures
.. Setting goals can only be done by controlled thinking
** [hiddenAnswer]#b.#

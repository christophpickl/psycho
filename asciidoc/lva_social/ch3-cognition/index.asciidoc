* Although computers start to beat humans more and more in intellectual tasks, there is still one critical task a human brain outperforms the fastest computer: To understand other people.
* The human brain has evolved powerful, finely tuned instruments to think about others.
* We are extremely good at *social cognition*: How we think about ourselves and the social world.
** It's far from perfect and often it is error prone. It has great powers, and also some limits.
* There are two kinds of social cognition: automatic (fast) and controlled (slow) thinking.

.Social Cognition
****
How we select/interpret/remember/use social information -> to judge/decide.
****

[#img-thinking_fast_slow]

== Low-Effort Thinking, Autopilot

[#img-rodin_thinker]
.Rodin's famous sculpture, _The Thinker_, mimics controlled (slow, deliberate) thinking. Yet, most of the time we think automatically (non-conscious, unintentional, involuntary and effortless).
image::images/rodins_thinker.png[Rodin's Thinker,300,100]

* We are good at evaluating a new situation quickly and accurately.
** Who is there. What is happening. What might happen next. Forming all sorts of impressions.
** Without us even being aware of it.
* It doesn't exhaust us, it is effortless.
** All of it is done without conscious analysis of what we are doing.

.Automatic Thinking
****
Thinking that is: non-conscious/unintentional/involuntary/effortless.
****

=== Everyday Theorists with Schemas

* Automatic thinking helps us to understand new situations, by relating them to prior experiences.
** E.g.: "an engineering student" or "like my cousin Emma".
** Not only for people, but also for places/objects/situations.
** The "fast-food restaurant schema" gets activated, entering a restaurant we never were before, knowing not to wait at the table being served.

.Schemas
****
Mental structures, to organize our knowledge; influencing info we notice/remember/think about.
****

* If we would have no schemas at all, everything would e inexplicable/confusing/unlike never seen anything before.
** Remember the so-called "_Korsakov's syndrome_" neurological disorder?
*** As Oliver Sacks described it in his famous book.
*** The inability to form new memories; every situation as if it would be the first.
* Schemas help in confusing/ambiguous situations.
** The more ambiguous info is, the more we use schemas to fill in the blanks.
* Expectations influence our impressions.
** Different schemas lead to different perceptions.
** E.g. "Just as I expected".
* Still it's totally reasonable to use them to resolve ambiguity.

=== Accessibility and Priming; Which Schemas to use?

* The world is full of ambiguous info that is open to interpretation.

.Accessibility
****
Infos (schemas/concepts) are more likely to be used when it's at the forefront of our mind.
****

* Schemas influence the way we make judgements, due to accessibility.
* Something becomes accessible because of 3 reasons:
** 1. Chronically accessible, due to past experience. Those are constantly active.
** 2. Something is related to a current goal. E.g. study for a test, it's temporarily accessible, until the test is over.
** 3. Because of recent experiences. It was primed before encountering an event. (see also dedicated link:../../phenomena/priming.html[priming page])

.Priming
****
Recent experiences increase accessibility of a schema/trait/concept.
****

* Can happen even though the new event is completely unrelated to the thoughts that were primed.
* E.g. see a homeless person in the street with a bottle of water.
** A. You just talked to your friend's father who is an alcoholic, thus -> you are primed to blame that homeless person as an alcoholic loser.
** B. You just got out of a communication-empathy class, thus -> you see the unfortunate events of that person and have compassion.
* Priming is a good example of automatic thinking, because it happens quickly/unintentionally/unconsciously.
* Thoughts have to be accessible AND applicable before they will prime us (=exerting influence on our impressions of the world).

=== Self-Fulfilling Prophecy; Making Schemas come true!

* We can inadvertently make our schemas come true, which is then called Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.

.Self-Fulfilling Prophecy
****
Expectations influence how we act; causing others to behave consistently; thus our expectations become true.
****

* One of the most famous studies in social psychology showing the link:../../phenomena/pygmalion_effect.html[Pygmalion Effect]:
** Told teachers that some random students will "bloom" academically.
** Thus creating certain expectations in the teachers.
** Those labeled as "bloomers" got indeed higher IQ scores.
** Replicated in experimental and correlational studies.
** Self-fulfilling prophecy is an example of automatic thinking.
** Treating "bloomers" differently:
*** Warmer emotional climate, more personal attention, encouragement, support.
*** More opportunities to respond, and more response time.
*** More material to learn, more difficult one.
*** More and better feedback.

*Do you believe in astrology?*

45% of Americans believe astrology has some scientific base. Whereas actually there is no good scientific evidence in support of astrology. But there is no _real_ power of astrology, giving people fake horoscopes randomly, and observing that the content of the horoscopes themselves caused people to act in a certain way. It's people's belief, not the horoscope itself which holds the power.
====

* We are only human, and as such we have faulty expectations.
** Based on: gender, race, social class, or family history.
* Still the power is not extreme, as having low expectations put on, there is still a chance.
** It will be just a bit harder to perform up to one's true abilities.

To sum up:

* We tend to reduce every day's overwhelming amount of information into manageable chunks.
** Sometimes this information is ambiguous or difficult to decipher.
** We use schemas to reduce the amount of and interpret information.
** Schemas are applied quickly, effortlessly, and unintentionally -automatic thinking.

== Automatic Thinking Types

=== Automatic Goal Pursuit

* When there are competing goals, we choose one automatically.
** Our non-conscious minds choose the goal for us, based which goal has been recently activated/primed.
* Priming with religious thoughts, we act more kindly. But only if people are religious to start with.
** E.g. when just leaving the church, more likely to donate money to a homeless (activated kindness).
* How to prime non-religious people? By being a "good citizen".
* Goals can be activated and influence people's behaviour without them knowing it.

=== Metaphors about Body and Mind

* How do we know how we think about someone? We check how our body is reacting.
** Research shows that a scent of cleanliness increases the degree to trust strangers.
*** Cleanliness is associated with morality. As in "washing away your sins" and "dirty thoughts".
** When we are tired, we interpret the world more negatively.
** Hot coffee activated the metaphor that friendly people are "warm".
* An interesting study showed that the weight of the clipboard influences how much a participants opinion would be considered.
** The survey paper was attached to the clipboard, which would be either light or heavy.
** Schema got activated (based on the weight) whether their opinion should be given more consideration.
** Associations of weight with importance due to "carries weight" or "adding weight to the argument".
* The mind is connected to the body, that's just a thing. And it can be primed.

=== Judgmental Heuristics; Mental Shortcuts

* We can't always conduct a thorough search of every option.
** To make things easier, we use mental strategies/shortcuts.
** Not every decision will end up in a major research project.
* Shortcuts are efficient, and usually lead to good decisions in a reasonable amount of time.
* Downsides:
** We not always have ready-made schemas available to apply.
** Sometimes there are too many schemas available, and it's not clear which one to apply.

.Judgmental Heuristics
****
Mental shortcuts to make judgments quickly/efficiently.
****

* The Greek word "heuristic" means "discover".
* Most of the time, they are highly functional and serve us well.

==== Availability Heuristic

* Our answers often rely on how easily different examples come to mind.
* So we base our judgement on the ease with which it can be brought to mind.

.Availability Heuristic
****
Basing a judgment on how easy something comes to mind.
****

* The downside: What is easiest to remember, is usually not the overall picture, leading to faulty conclusions.
** E.g. when physicians are diagnosing diseases: A symptom can be sign of several different disorders.
*** Once there was a tricky case, and one doctor finally got it right. Why? Because he just finished writing a book about this disease.
*** The doctor stated: "I happened to run into each other in exactly the right place, at exactly the right time".
* Do we use this heuristic also judge ourselves?
** Seems so, but we often lack firm schemas about our own traits.
** We base our judgments how easily we can recall examples of our own behavior.
* A study checked about availability and assertiveness:
** Ask a group to think of 6 times they behaved assertively. They then though they were pretty assertive.
** Ask another group to think of 12 times they behaved assertively. They did not think of themselves to be assertive.
** They based their judgments on availability, or how easily they can bring information to mind.
** "If I can't come up with that many points, it must not be the case".
** Or ask your students to give criticism about your class to make them like it more, iff you demand a long list.
*** "If I can't come up with that many criticisms, it must be a great course!"

==== Representativeness Heuristic

* Or: "How similar is A to B".

.Representativeness Heuristic
****
A mental shortcut, classifying something according to how similar it is to a typical case.
****

* This seems a perfectly reasonable thing to do.
* And we do so by using a base rate information.

.Base Rate Information
****
Information about frequency of members of different categories in the population.
****

* What if we have a base rate information and a contradictory piece of information about something?
** link:../../people/kahnemann_daniel.html[Kahneman] figured that people don't use base rate information sufficiently.
** If the base rate is low, you would need to have very good evidence, to guess that this is one of the few exceptions.
* People often focus too much on individual characteristics, and too little on the base rates.

==== Personality Tests

[NOTE.tryit,caption=TRY IT]
====
*Reasoning Quiz*

. Does the letter k occur more often as first or third letter?
.. First
.. Third
.. Equally often
** [hiddenAnswer]#b) In fact, three times more often. link:../../people/kahnemann_daniel.html[Kahneman] figured most people think it as a) first letter, as it comes easier to mind (link:../../phenomena/availability_bias.html[availability heuristic]).#
. Consider someone who is 1) incompetent 2) middle-aged 3) likes reading 4) asocial. Based on *representativeness heuristic*, what would most people think of him being?
.. Sales person
.. History professor
.. Taxi driver
** [hiddenAnswer]#b) Also Kahneman figured out that we assess a job based on our stereotypes.#
. Flip a coin six times, which is more likely?
.. HTTHTH
.. HHHTTT
.. Equally often
** [hiddenAnswer]#c) Kahnemann figured that although these are random outcomes, we expect the result to "look random" (representativeness heuristic). It conforms to our conception of randomness. Same as with a lottery ticket 6957 or 1111, both are equally likely to be picked.#
. Flip a coin five times HHHHH, what will be next?
.. T
.. H
.. Equally often
** [hiddenAnswer]#c) Kahneman figured each toss is independent, but people want to "even things out", the so-called link:../../phenomena/gamblers_fallacy.html[gambler's fallacy].#

====

* The link:../../phenomena/barnum_effect.html[Barnum Effect] explains why you might feel like "oh wow, that's me!"
** When statements are too vague (personality checks; horoscopes?), virtually everyone can find a past behavior that is similar to (representative of) the feedback.

== Cultural Differences

* What is the influence of culture on social cognition?
* Is automatic thinking done by everyone around the world? Or more common in some cultures?

=== Cultural Determinants of Schemas

* Everyone uses schemas, and their content are influenced by our culture.
* Cultures inject mental structures, which influence how we interpret the world.
* Different cultures have fundamentally different schemas
* They strongly influence what we notice/remember about the world.

=== Holistic vs Analytic

[#img-holistic_aquarium]
.Looking at this picture, do you focus more on specific on the fish in the foreground and their properties (analytic/Western) or on the fish in relation to the surrounding and the context in general (holistic/Eastern).
image::images/holistic_aquarium.png[Analytic or Holistic,300,100]

* Human minds are like toolboxes filled with tools to think and act.
** All humans have the same tools, culture determines which we use most.
* Not all kinds of thinking are shared among all humans.
** Some are shaped by culture.
* In Western cultures, we tend to use an *analytic thinking style*.
** We focus on properties of objects (foreground) without considering the surrounding context.

.Analytic Thinking Style
****
Focus on object properties without considering context (Western style).
****

* Asian/Eastern cultures tend to have a *holistic thinking style*.
** Focus is on the overall context (background), particularly how objects relate to each other.

.Holistic Thinking Style
****
Focus on overall context, how objects interrelate (Eastern/Asian style).
****

* Thinking styles also influence how we perceive emotions in others.
* They come from philosophical traditions originally; East versus West.
** Eastern: Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism. Emphasizing connectedness, relativity of all things.
** Western: Greek (Aristotle, Plato). Emphasizing laws governing objects, independent of their context.
*** _Note from Christoph_: Reductionism. Analysis (dissecting). Newtons view of a mechanical world.
* Thinking styles might also differ due to differences in the environment.
** More crowded cities in Japan led them to be significantly more aware of information/objects.
* All cultures are capable of thinking in either way.
** Whether we use one or the other depends on our environment, and even whether we were recently primed to it.

[NOTE.test,caption=REVIEW QUESTIONS]

== High-Effort Thinking, Controlled Cognition

.Controlled Thinking
****
Conscious, intentional, voluntary, effortful thinking.
****

* It's the hallmark of humans.
** We are (as far as we know) the only species capable of conscious reflection.
** We can turn it on/off and are fully aware of it.
** It requires mental energy; we can do only one thing at a time (so much about multi-tasking).
* So why even automatic thinking?
** It's more powerful and prevalent than believed in the past.
** Others think we underestimated the value and power of controlled thinking.

=== Controlled Thinking and Free Will

* We freely choose much less than we think we are, because of the unconscious automatic thoughts that control our behavior.
* There is an _illusion_ of free will, which is very much like the "correlation does not equal causation" problem.
** There might be third variable at play, an unconscious intention that caused the conscious thought/behavior.
* The conscious thought of "I want ice cream" is the consequence of an unconscious process, and not the cause of your decision to go to the freezer.
** The unconscious desire triggered the action.
** We tend to believe that we exert more conscious control over events than we really are.
* It also works the other way round:
** See the problem with trained facilitators using keyboards (facilitated communication) to let people diagnosed with ASD communicate.
** They unconsciously manipulated the hand of those patients, and were discredited as the trainers did the typing.
** They didn't do it deliberately; they genuinely believed what they thought has happened.
* Interesting fact though: The more we believe in free will, the more we are willing to hel pothers, and the less we act immorally.
* Regardless how much free will we _really_ have, it's best to believe as we have it fully.

|6. | be in close contact with friends | disconnect with friends        | both are possible
|===

[upperalpha,start=2]
. Choose one item per row that will happen most likely to a friend of yours in a year.

[cols="0,1,1,1"]
|===
|1. | have a well-paid job             | have a low-paid job            | both are possible
|2. | purchase a car                   | continue public transportation | both are possible

|6. | be in close contact with friends | disconnect with friends        | both are possible
|===

Once you are done, read the following paragraphs:

* We tend to believe that we have more free will than others.
* In studies it showed we circle "both are possible" for us 52% of the cases, and for others 36%.
* We think others' actions were more predetermined than our own.
====

=== Counterfactual Reasoning

* Or: "Mentally undoing the past"
* When do we use controlled thinking and when go on automatic pilot?
** In negative events that were a "close call" (almost passed a test), we use counterfactual reasoning.

.Counterfactual Reasoning
****
Imagining what might have been, by mentally changing aspects of the past.
****

* This reasoning can have a big influence on our emotional reactions to events.
** The easier to mentally undo an outcome, the stronger the emotional reaction.
** E.g. It makes us much angrier when failing a test by 1, than by 10 points.
** E.g. It makes us happier to finish a competition 3rd over 2nd, as we can more easily imagine how we could have been 1st.
* Well, if you lose next time, just try not to lose by a slim margin ;)
* It was also shown that counterfactual reasoning about positive events increases belief in God.
* It is conscious and effortful, as we are aware that we are obsessing about the past.
** It is yet not always intentional/voluntary: Sometimes it's difficult to turn it off.
** "If only" kind of thinking and rumination (thinking in circles) is a contributor to depression.
* Counterfactual thinking can be useful to cope better in the future.
** It gives us a heightened sense of control over our fate and motivates us to do better next time.

=== Improving Thinking

* Controlled thinking kicks in when an unusual event occurs.
** E.g. when an aircraft pilot turns off the auto pilot to take control in case of trouble.
* Improvement is difficult when we are too optimistic about the accuracy of our judgements.
* As Kahneman et al showed, we often estimate to finish our projects in time too optimistically.
** We tend to think that this time will be different.

.Planning Fallacy
****
Too optimistic when we finish something, even in the past we failed to do so.
****

* We can improve our thinking by using statistical/methodological principles about how to reason correctly.
** Lectures in research design and statistics thus can help.
** E.g. generalize from a sample of information, only when based on a large, unbiased sample
** Learn how to apply those principles to daily life.

[NOTE.tryit,caption=TRY IT]

*How well do you reason?* (asses methodological and statistical reasoning)

. "The more churches in a city, the higher the crime rate there", thus: Shut down the churches. Or not?
.. Only 90% of cities were analyzed, but we need to reach 100%.
.. Research team was not religious, they don't understand.
.. Not taken the city size into account, which might be a third variable which correlates.
.. Same was not observed in other countries. It could be inverted correlated there.
** [hiddenAnswer]#c. Whereas others might be true as well, this answers reflects sound methodological reasoning: A better test would be the compare the crime rate in similar countries.#
. In baseball, at the beginning batter averages first 2 weeks high, but towards the end much lower. Why?
.. Average at beginning is just a lucky fluke.
.. Good start creates lots of stress with a negative impact.
.. Players get in better shape over the course of the season.
.. The play more the corners.
** [hiddenAnswer]#a. Whereas others might be true as well, this answer reflects sound statistical reasoning: Large sample of information would better show the true numbers. Like a coin flipped 4 times, it is easily possible to get 4 times head, but throwing it a thousand time not.#
====

* If you want to get better in accurately and logically reason on everyday problems:
** No need to be intelligent, it's not about that.
** Get some formal training in statistics!
* People are like "flawed scientists", there are often blind to truths that don't fit their schemas.

=== Summary

* Dis-/advantages of schemas
** Low-effort (automatic) thinking (Auto-pilot)
*** We are good at social cognition (=thinking about ourselves and the social world).
*** Automatic thinking: non-conscious, unintentional, involuntary, effortless.
** Automatic thinking with schemas
*** Schemas (mental structures):
*** Using past knowledge.
*** To organize/interpret our knowledge.
*** It influences what we notice/remember/think about.
*** Useful to reduce ambiguity.
** Accessibility
*** If situation not clear, use highest in accessibility.
*** Whatever comes easiest to mind, due to: lot used in the past, or current goal.
** Priming
*** Recent experiences increase accessibility of schema.
** Self-fulfilling prophecy
*** Expectation about another person, influences our own behavior, which causes them to behave consistently with our expectation.
* Automatic thinking types
** Automatic goal pursuit: If many competing goals, choose one unconsciously (been primed maybe).
** Body-mind metaphors: physical sensations (weight of clipboard) prime a metaphor, influencing the judgment.
** Judgmental heuristics: Mental shortcuts to make judgments quick/efficient.
*** E.g. availability heuristic: How easy something comes to mind.
*** E.g. representativeness heuristic: Classify something by how similar it is to a typical case.
* Cultural influences
** Differences: "Mind as a toolbox": We all have same, specific tools, but culture dictates which ones we use most.
** Schema determinants: We all use schemas, but their content is influenced by culture.
** Holistic vs analytic thinking: Western/analytic/object-properties VS Eastern/holistic/context&relations
* Controlled thinking drawbacks/improvements
** Controlled is high-effort, conscious, intentional, voluntary
** Free will
*** Discrepancy believe of causing own actions VS reality
*** Yet believe in it: more likely to help, less likely to be immoral (cheat)
** Counterfactual reasoning (undoing the past)
*** Imagining "what might have been"
** Improved thinking: Get training in statistical reasoning!
** Flawed Scientists: Try to discover social world in logical manner, but doing so imperfectly.

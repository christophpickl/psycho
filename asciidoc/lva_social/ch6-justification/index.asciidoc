"_Cognitive Dissonance and the Need to Protect Our Self-Esteem_"

== Theory of Cognitive Dissonance

* Question: Have you ever done something stupid to be member of a group?
** Some committed mass suicide, to get a ticket to a new life in paradise in a gigantic spaceship.
** One of them bought a telescope, but wanted to return it because he couldn't see that spaceship.
** Conclusion: The telescope must be broken, because he "knows" the alien spaceship must be there.
** Member's of the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven%27s_Gate_(religious_group)[Heaven's Gate cult], among this particular member, were also pleasant, smart, and reasonable.
* What is the process such fantastic thinking and self-destructive behavior happens?
** An extreme example of a normal human tendency: The need to justify our actions and commitments.

* So what is *cognitive dissonance*, and how do we avoid it to maintain a positive self-image?
* As we saw in link:../ch1-introduction/index.html[chapter 1], self-esteem is our evaluation of our self-worth (we view ourselves as good/competent/decent).
* As we saw in the previous link:../ch5-self/index.html[chapter 5], the function of the self is to maintain our self-esteem.
* It seems that the biggest determinant of our behavior is the motivation to preserve a stable, positive self-image.
* link:../../people/festinger-leon.html[Leon Festinger] developed the most provocative theory in psychology: The theory of cognitive dissonance.

.Cognitive Dissonance
****
The discomfort, felt when our behavior threatens our self-esteem.
****

* Or how Festinger defined it: The discomfort that is caused when two cognitions conflict, or when our behavior conflicts with our attitudes.
** This definition was revised by his student Elliot Aronson: Dissonance is most painful (and most motivated to be reduced) when dissonant cognitions challenge our self-esteem (sense of self-worth).
* How can it be reduced then?
** Changing behavior (align it with the dissonant cognition)
** Changing a dissonant cognition (to justify our behavior)
** Adding new cognitions (also to justify our behavior)
* Take *smoking* for example:
** Imagine you tried, and failed in the past. You might feel bad about yourself.
** To reduce dissonance, change one of your dissonant cognitions: belief that smoking is harmful.
** So now you are free to continue smoking without feeling terrible about it.
** Applying the three strategies above to reduce dissonance and be happy again:
... Stop smoking (change behavior)
... Change cognitions (smoking isn't bad)
... Add consonant cognition (smoking is relaxing)
** Young people tend to justify this by saying things like "smoking is cool", "I want to be like my friends", "in movies, everyone smokes", "I'm healthy; nothing is going to happen to e", "adults are always on my back about stuff I do", or "who wants to be 90 anyway".
** Sometimes people say that it's worth the risk, it's enjoyable, it relaxes them and reduces nervous tension and therefor actually improves their health.

[#img-cognitive_strategies]
.How to reduce cognitive dissonance
image::images/cognitive_strategies.jpg[Dealing with cognitive dissonance,800,100]

* Once you understood dissonance, you will see it all around you. For example:
** End of the world predictions claim to be accurate, they just used the numbers from the wrong chapter of the bible.
** When central aspects of our identity conflict, as in being gay and Christian. One way is to leave the church or even religion, or to stay and claim "it's not my religion, it's the bigotry of this particular preacher".
* Human thinking is not rational, but rationalizing.
** No matter how smart you are: You will behave irrationally and maladaptively.
** Once we are committed to our views and beliefs, we will distort new information so it will confirm us (see also link:../../phenomena/confirmation_bias.html[confirmation bias]).
** People believing in discredited ideas (vaccines cause autism) or receiving bad news about our health.
** We are very "creative" in denying evidence and reducing discomfort.
** We rationalize our actions, and interpret facts to fit what we already believe.

=== Decisions, Decisions

* With every single decision, we experience a bit of dissonance.
* In the following section you will we see why \...

==== Distorting dis/likes

* When we choose one option, the chosen one is never entirely positive, and the rejected alternative never entirely negative.
* After deciding, we think of ourselves being a smart person, which is dissonant with the negative aspects of your choice; and also with the positive ones of the rejected option.

.Postdecision Dissonance
****
After making a decision, making choice more attractive, and devaluating rejected option.
****

* We make some unconscious mental work to try reducing dissonance, to make us feel better about our decision.

==== Decision Permanence

* The more important the decision is, the greater the dissonance.
* Decisions differ in how permanent they are (how difficult to revoke them).
** If a decision is final, it produces a lot of dissonance.
** E.g. deciding for an education, we inflate positive aspects of it, and minimize those of alternatives.
* Keeping options open makes us less happy, as the finality of decisions actually does.

=== Illusion of Irrevocability

.Lowballing
****
An somewhat unethical strategy (by salespeople) to promise to sell a product for a low price, then claiming there was an error, and gradually increase the price; hoping the customer will still agree.
****

* It works because:
.. Some sort of commitment, by saying yes to the initial (wrong) price. Although sometimes knowing it wasn't a binding contract.
.. Anticipation of an exciting event, due to the commitment; to say no would have meant a big letdown.
.. The new price might be only slightly higher than at other sellers, and justifies his commitment by explaining the already invested effort (e.g. signing the forms).

=== Justification of Effort

* Imagine you put in a lot of effort to get into a particular club.
** Turns out, it's totally worthless. You would feel pretty dumb, right?!
** This will lead to a significant amount of dissonance.
** You might want to convince yourself how nicer, more interesting/worthwhile the club/people are.
** Doing so is possible because activities/behaviors are open to a wide range of possible interpretations.
** If being motivated (reduction of dissonance), we tend to interpret these ambiguities in a positive way.
** And the more effort we put it, the more we will like it; even (especially!) if it's something we don't actually like.

.Justification of Effort
****
Increase liking for something worked hard.
****

* E.g. the harsh training experienced in the army increases group cohesiveness and pride to be a part of this organization.
* If we didn't put any effort in it to get it, and we didn't enjoy it, we see things clearly.
** If there was some sort of severe (effortful/painful) initiation, we convince ourselves it was worthwhile.
** E.g. religious rituals (like the Hindu festival of Thaipusam) convinces people that the greater a men's pain, the greater their commitment to the temple.
* If we _choose_ though to go through a demanding/unpleasant experience, the goal/object becomes more attractive.
** E.g. If you want to join a group, and while walking their you got splashed, your liking towards the group wouldn't change. But if you volunteered to jump into a mud puddle to be admitted to the group, you _would_ like the group better.

=== Counter-attitudinal Behavior

* Imagine your friend bought a product you consider bad but he can't return it anymore.
** You might think something like: "_He seems happy about it, and spent a lot of money for it and can't take it back. If I say what I think, I'll upset him._"
** So you go ahead, and lie (harmony/peace/comfort over truth/honesty/authenticity) and say you like it. You won't feel much dissonance though.
** Your thoughts/values are consistent with this lie.
** It is important not to embarrass or cause pain to people you like, which is an external justification for this harmless lie.

.External Justification
****
Reason/explanation for dissonant personal behavior that's on the outside (reward/punishment).
****

* What if your friend can afford to absorb the costs? Would you still lie?
** If so, then there is no external justification for lying, and you will experience more dissonance.
** If we can't find external, we try to find internal justification.

.Internal Justification
****
Reduction of dissonance by changing yourself (attitude/behavior).
****

* You might try to look harder for something positive about the object.
** As a result, your attitude towards it will be more aligned with your statement/lie.
** Thus: "_Saying becomes believing_."

.Counterattitudinal Behavior
****
Acting against one's own beliefs/attitudes.
****

* Counterattitudinal behavior happens when our behavior conflicts with our private beliefs/attitudes.
** E.g. simply claiming to have an opinion/attitude that differs from our true beliefs.
* Most common experiment is where people getting paid 0/1/20 dollars for doing a boring task and then convincing others that it's great.
** Receiving lots of external justification for lying and not believing it requires no internal justification. Otherwise necessary to convince oneself "why did I do that"?
** Another similar one is: Being bullied by kids, then giving them money for doing so, then gradually decrease the amount, until they stop because they don't get paid doing it anymore.

==== Consequential Issues

* Counterattitudinal behavior toward consequential issues
* It is possible to change people's attitude towards important issues, like prejudice and eating disorders.
** You do so by providing small incentives.
* The media's "thin ideal" leads to unhappiness, constant dieting and eating disorders.
** Creating a dissonance condition, by writing an essay why "thin is beautiful" is unhealthy; the emotional and physical costs pursuing this unrealistic ideal body is irrational.
** People doing this exercise showed significant increase in body satisfaction, decrease in chronic dieting (bulimia risk reduced), and were happier and less anxious.

==== Ben Franklin Effect

* Justifying acts of kindness; see link:../../phenomena/ben_franklin.html[Ben Franklin Effect page]
* Doing a small favor towards a person you don't like, is an example of counterattitudinal behavior.
** Thus, it creates dissonance, and we reduce it by convincing ourselves that we like that person.

==== Justifying cruelty

* Dehumanizing the enemy is a rather universal phenomena.
** We do so by calling them cruel names like: animals, brutes, or other nonhuman creatures.
* Use of such language is to reduce dissonance: "I am a good person, but we are fighting and killing these other people; therefore, they must deserve whatever they get, because they aren't fully human like us."
* Difficult to know whether self-justification can follow acts of cruelty, rather causing them.


[NOTE.tryit,caption=TRY IT]
====
*Internal consequences of doing good*

You take the bus regularly and often see elderly people struggling to find a seat. You don't feel compassionate for them, and never gave up your seat, as you both pay the same bus fare (equality, right?).

Suppose that one day you decide to give up your seat for an elderly person. Based on cognitive dissonance theory, how would your attitude toward helping the elderly be affected by your prosocial action?
====

* PTSD in war veterans is often due to the inability to reduce dissonance over killing children, bystanders and other innocent civilians, instead of formal army members.
* Dehumanizing the victim leads to a continuation (or even escalation) of cruelty.
** An endless chain of violence followed by self-justification; e.g. Nazi's "Final Solution".
** This is how tyrants and oppressors make it possible for themselves to sleep at night (reducing dissonance).
* Dictators were interviewed doing all kind of violent acts (starving citizens, looting wealth, torture and murder, genocidal wars).
** All of them claimed they were doing it for the good of their country. The alternative was chaos, anarchy, and bloodshed.
** They saw themselves as self-sacrificing patriots.

==== Immoral acts

* Counterattitudinal behavior: Act contrary our moral beliefs.
** E.g.: Once you cheat on a test, you will try to convince yourself that "everybody would cheat if they had the chance"; it hurts nobody (Mills experiments).
** Your self-esteem is threatened as dissonance arouses.
** If you cheat, your belief "I'm a moral person" is dissonant with your cognition "I did something immoral".
*** Solution: To make yourself feel good (reduce dissonance) about your immoral act, you change your attitude about cheating.
** If you resist to cheat, your cognition "I want to become a doctor" is dissonant with another cognition "I could have passed the exam by cheating, but I chose not to. Wow, was I stupid!".
*** Solution: Change your attitude in the opposite direction: Cheating is a terrible sin, cheaters should be punished.
** These are not only simple rationalizations, but a change in your value-system.

=== Avoiding Temptations

* To avoid temptations, virtually all societies run (in part) on punishment or a threat of it.
** Yet it doesn't work, as once the punishment is removed, we still will do it (e.g. not being observed). It teaches us to try to avoid getting caught.
** E.g. If you tell your children not to hit each other, they will continue doing it once you are out of sight; you taught them to not do it while you are around.

.Insufficient Punishment
****
Dissonance when we lack sufficient external justification for having resisted; devaluing the forbidden.
****

* A severe threat would create an external justification for not doing it.
* A mild threat would create an insufficient punishment.
* E.g. your child asks himself "Why didn't I beat up my little brother?"
** There is no convincing answer, as the punishment is so mild, it doesn't provide a superabundance of justification.
** The justification for refraining from beating his brother up is not strong enough to explain his compliance.
** The child must find another way to justify his compliance: By substituting the external with an *internal* justification:
*** Reducing dissonance by convincing himself he doesn't want to beat him up; maybe even decide beating up other kids is not fun.
* The less external justification there is, the more internal justification is created.
* E.g. children given a forbidden toy and a mild punishment:
** They were less likely to play with it (than a group with a more severe punishment) as their own, internal justification led to devaluing the attractiveness of the toy (effectively reducing dissonance).
*** "I didn't want to play with it anyhow."
** For the group with severe punishment, the toy stayed highly desirable, as they had no reason to change their attitude.
*** Behavior was explained due to avoiding being punished (some even liked it more).
* Big rewards / severe punishments provide strong external justification, leading to compliance, but preventing real attitude change.
** This strategy is thus good if the behavior is needed only *once*.
** But if you want a person to stay committed, a smaller reward/punishment will be better for a permanent change in attitude.

=== Hypocrisy Paradigm

* Hypocrites judge others more harshly, and present themselves as more virtuous and ethical.
** Polarizing judgements: More evil out there (others), more good (righteousness) in here.
* Although we know that STIs can be prevented by using condoms, there is a tendency to not use them.
** Condoms are unromantic, inconvenient, less pleasurable and remind us of diseases.
** Common denial: "Sure, STIs are a problem, but not for _me_."

[#img-condom]
.Understanding dissonance helps us to make healthier, safer choices.
image::images/condom.jpg[Condom,500,100]

* When being made aware (mindfulness) of our own failure (to use condoms), we change our behavior to the better.
** When told to preach (give a presentation over safety,) but we don't act upon it, we feel dissonance.
** To remove the hypocrisy and maintain our self-esteem: change behavior.

.Hypocrisy Induction
****
Making people feel dissonance due to statements that are oppositional to their behaviors, and then reminding them of the inconsistency (walk your talk), with the goal to create more responsible behavior.
****

* As well applicable to quit smoking, use sunscreen, or stop disordered eating.
* When being reminded of our own fallibility, we are quicker to go from anger to forgiveness.
** It reduces our need to retaliate.

=== In Cultures

* Dissonance is across cultures; found in almost every part of the world.
** BUT: It doesn't have always the same form, and content of cognition may differ.
* In *collectivist* societies: less prevalent (on the surface)
** More about maintaining group harmony, less about justifying own personal misbehavior.
** Experience dissonance when they shamed/disappointed others.
** Japan: Attitudes changes to conform to those of their dissonance reducing friends. Justified when felt observed.
** America: Reversed pattern is true.
** Privacy or public visibility; culture determines dissonance or not.
* Most causes are: international and intergenerational.
** America: Immigrant parents (be like us; love us) and young-adult children (fit the peers) often clash (not embracing all parents' values).

== Advances and Extensions of the Theory

We need to see ourselves as: intelligent, sensible, decent, behaving with integrity (protecting our self-esteem).

=== Self-Affirmation Theory

* Three ways of reducing dissonance:
.. Change behavior (align with dissonant cognition)
.. Change dissonant cognition (align with behavior)
.. justify behavior (add new cognition)
* E.g. smoking:
.. Stop smoking (change behavior)
.. convince oneself smoking isn't bad (change cognition)
.. decide it's worth it, enjoyable and not want to life long (add new cognition)
* Sometimes this is not easily done though... a fourth possibility: self-affirming

.Self-Affirmation Theory
****
Reducing threats to self-esteem, by affirming ourselves in areas unrelated to that threat's source.
****

* Reduce dissonance by focusing on, and affirming our competence on some dimension _unrelated_ to the threat
** E.g.: "Yes, it's true that I smoke, but I am a great cook!"
** That may sound silly, but not for the person trying to reduce one's dissonance.
** We can't reduce the threat to our self-esteem directly (with the first three options), but we can focus on how great we are in completely different areas.
* Experiment (Brehm): let people rate objects; then choose one; then let them rate again
** Chosen ones being now rated higher (convinced themselves that they made a smart decision); rejected ones lower.
* Experiment: science students wearing a lab coat, making a dumb decision and admitting it, but "at least I'm a promising scientist".
* How apply in daily live, mitigate threats to self-esteem? _Values affirmation writing exercise_!
** Pick the most important value of a list of many, and write why this one is so important.
** Long lasting effect; reminding ourselves when failing in one (e.g. work) we are good in other parts (e.g. family) which are important to us.
** Doing this made students having less academic anxiety and did better in school; more likely to go to college
*** Why? Reducing threats to their self-esteem with a simple writing exercise.

[NOTE.tryit,caption=TRY IT]
====
*Values Affirmation Writing Exercise*

Rank this list of characteristics/values from least to most important:

* Being good at art
* Creativity
* Relationships with family/friends
* Government, politics
* Independence
* Learning/gaining knowledge
* Athletic ability
* Belonging to a social group (community, racial group, sports club)
* Music
* Spiritual/religious values
* Sense of humor

Now choose one and write about why this is important to you. Take a few minutes to write a full page. Write about times when it was especially important to you.
====

=== Self-Evaluation Maintenance Theory

* "_Dissonance in close relationships_"
* Dissonance arises in interpersonal relationships as well, when we compare our own accomplishments with others'.
* E.g. you think you are a good soccer player.
** You move to another town, and your new best friend is a professional soccer player. How does that make you feel?
** *Maybe a bit uneasy that he outdoes you in "your area" of expertise?
** Now instead that he is a pro soccer player, he is a very talented painter. Do you feel anyhow uncomfortable?
*** Probably not. Most likely you even take pleasure in your friend's success.
* We will feel dissonance in relationship under three conditions:
.. We feel close to that person.
.. He is outperforming us in a particular area.
.. That area is central to our self-esteem.
* Thus, dissonance only occurs when a friend is better at a task which is important to us as we define ourselves with it.
* To reduce that dissonance (which threatens our self-esteem), we can do three things:
.. Distance ourselves from that person (not a close friend anymore; not wanting to work with him anymore).
.. Reconsidering how important that activity is to our self-esteem (losing interest in soccer; not important to us anymore).
.. Become even better at that activity; but if your friend is still better, you might go down a diabolic route: undermine (sabotage) his performance, so you are superior.

.Self-Evaluation Maintenance Theory
****
People close to us, outperforming us in an area central to our self-esteem. Reducing dissonance by 1) getting distant to that person 2) get better than him 3) or area not important anymore.
****

* Does that mean that we are evil beings, trying to sabotage our friends to feel better?
** Definitely not always, but when our self-esteem is at stake, we may not be as helpful as we would like to think.
* If the task is not important to us, we are easy going supporting our friends, wishing them the best.
** When the task is high in self-relevance though, e.g. the game/test is highly correlated with intelligence or leadership skills, people gave _harder_ clues to their friends than to strangers.
** It feels threatening to our self-esteem, if friends outperform us, so we make sure they do not.
* Summed up, self-evaluation maintenance theory shows us that threats to our self-concept have fascinating implications for our interpersonal relationships.

== Concluding Thoughts

* Ways to overcome dissonance, and the pros/cons of having high self-esteem.
* When we make important decisions with high investments (time, effort, sacrifice, commitment), we have a huge need to justify those actions.
** The more we give up, the more we need to convince ourselves that our views are correct (we did the right thing).

*Law and Cognitive Dissonance*

In 2013 during the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, someone was beaten by the police, causing great unrest among the people. The protesters were unarmed and subdued, still the police officers attacked them. How would the judicial system have had reduced the dissonance arising from conflicting assertions of "We are morally responsible people," and "We beat up an already subdued protester who was pinned to the ground"?

They did so by adding a new cognition. We did it for the stability of Hong Kong, to teach them a lesson to conform to rules and authorities. The officers got only suspended from duty and denied doing any grievous bodily harm.

This kind of power abuse happens often all over the world. These people don't believe they are doing intentionally malevolent things, as they are deceiving themselves. Convincing themselves they are doing harm for the greater good, in the interest of the common people; a very typical self-justifying behavior for human beings which happens everywhere and all the time.
====

* Most of the time dissonance-reducing behavior is useful, as it maintains our self-esteem.
** We also need to learn from our mistakes / bad decisions / incorrect behavior (to grow/change).
** Not always defend ourselves, by ignoring, justifying, or turning those into virtues.
** We would get stuck within the confines of our narrow minds.
* Most extreme cases, we even could harm ourselves and others (Heaven's Gates case).

=== Overcoming Dissonance

* Although we self-justify unconsciously, once we are aware of it we can monitor our thinking, "catching ourselves in the act".
** To examine our behavior critically/dispassionately.
** Acknowledge our mistakes and take responsibility.
* Hard facts will trump opinion and belief.
* When being confronted with evidence that we were wrong about something important to us (belief/behavior)...
** Try justifying the mistake, or strive to correct it?

=== Narcissism

* "_\... and the dangers of too much self-esteem."
* Narcissists have difficulties recognizing their dissonance (mistakes) and admitting they were wrong.

.In Greek mythology, Narcissus feel in love with his own reflection so much that he couldn't leave and eventually died.
image::images/narcissus.png[Narcisuss,600,100]

.Narcissism
****
Combination of excessive self-love and lack of empathy.
****

* Narcissists are self-centered, concerned more with themselves than others.

====

* Having too low self-esteem is obviously bad.
** It will lead to depression and feelings of being ineffective, having no control over our lives.
** It also protects us against thoughts about our own mortality.
** Protection from anxiety, caused by thoughts about our own death.
** We embrace cultural worldviews that make us feel meaningful/purposeful.

.Terror Management Theory
****
Self-esteem helps to protect from terrifying thoughts about our mortality.
****

* Love ourselves too much (becoming a narcissist) and problems will arise.
** Doing worse in academia and business.
** Doing worse socially, as being more violent/aggressive and thus disliked by others (once people get to know them better).
** Being poor at looking in the mirror and seeing themselves for who they really are.
** In order to grow, and learn from our mistakes, we need to examine our behavior critically, and admit we were wrong.
*** Narcissist are especially bad at this.
*** Reduce dissonance in ways to preserve wonderful view on themselves.
* Narcissism has increased the last 40 years, as tracked by the NPI (Narcissistic Personality Inventory).
** Especially prevalent among America's college students.
** Reason is unknown, but speculation goes because of self-focused American culture.
** Increasing amount of self-reference (through first-person singular pronouns, such as: "I", "me") in song lyrics and books.
* Not everyone is extremely self-focused of course, we still like to help others.
** As a matter of fact, helping others (through volunteer work) makes ourselves happier (more effective than the narcissistic route).
** Imagine receiving an envelope with 20 euros in it; those who spent it on others are happier than those who spent it on themselves.

To sum up:

* Having high self-esteem is a good thing, as it makes us optimistic about the future and work harder.
** If it gets too much (along lack of empathy), narcissism arises.
* Best is to feel good about ourselves, and still be able to learn from our mistakes, and to care about others.

== Summary

=== Cognitive dissonance and how to avoid it to maintain a positive self-image

* The self's function is to protect/maintain our *self-esteem*.
** Self-esteem being: how we evaluate our self-worth, seeing ourselves as good, competent, and decent.
** Dissonance arises when our self-esteem is threatened.
** Reduce it by changing behavior, justifying our behavior by changing dissonant cognition or adding a new one.
* Decisions
** After deciding, there will be dissonance, as we choose for one and implicitly not for the other.
** *Post-decision dissonance*: The discomfort experienced that we may have made the wrong choice.
** After the decision is final, we "solidify" it; the more permanent/irrevocable, the stronger the need to reduce dissonance.
** *Lowballing*: A salesperson strategy offering a low price at first, the claiming it being an error, and subsequently raising the price.
* *Justification of Effort*
** We like things more when they were hard to get. Think of loyalty for fraternities and military ("initiation rituals").
* *Counter-attitudinal Behavior*
** When we act counter our private belief/attitude.
** Big external justification (large reward), no dissonance, no attitude change.
** Reward small, we resort to internal justification; reduction of dissonance by changing attitude/behavior.
*** Much more powerful effect on our long-term values/behaviors.
*** Good against: prejudices, self-defeating beliefs, harmful practices like bulimia.
** Benjamin Franklin effect: Ask someone for a little favour, internal justification will make them like you more, as they did something nice to you.
*** Other way round as well: When you did something bad, make your victims less worth, deserved it, none of your people, less than human (during war).
* *Avoiding Temptations*
** Change people by giving them mild threats ("insufficient punishment") not to do something.
*** Dissonance due to not enough external justification for having resisted a desired activity/object.
** The less severe the punishment/smaller the reward, the more internal justification necessary.
* *Hypocrisy Paradigm*
** By hypocrisy induction, confronting people the difference between what they say and what they do.
** The need to reduce dissonance can lead to behavioral change (condoms for AIDS-prevention).
* Dissonance across *cultures*
** It occurs cross-culturally, but the content differs.
** As well as the process and the intensity of dissonance reduction do vary (due to differences in cultural norms).

=== Advances and extensions of cognitive dissonance theory

* *Self-Affirmation Theory*
** Reducing dissonance by focusing on an unrelated domain.
** The values affirmation writing exercise (write why a value is important to you) shows lasting positive effects.
* *Self-Evaluation Maintenance Theory*
** Conditions: When a close friend (1) outperforms us(2) in an area central to our self-esteem (3).
** Strategies: Dissonance reduction by stop friendship (1), doing better (2), not that important to us (3); in extreme cases: sabotage.

=== Overcoming dissonance and pros/cons of high self-esteem

* Reducing dissonance to maintain our self-esteem is ok.
** But if we do it all the time, defending our egos, we would never learn from mistake/bad decisions/incorrect beliefs.
* *Overcoming it*
** Dissonance reduction becomes counterproductive when it solidifies negative values/behaviors.
** By awareness; consciously pause the self-justification process to reflect on our action.
* *Narcissism*
** A high self-esteem protects from depression, persevere in the face of failure, and protects us from thoughts about our own mortality (terror management theory).
** But extreme high self-esteem, combined with lack of empathy, leads to narcissism (with all its consequences).
** Best combination: Feel good about yourself, but also care about others.

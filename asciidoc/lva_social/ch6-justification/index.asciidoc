"_Cognitive Dissonance and the Need to Protect Our Self-Esteem_"

== Theory of Cognitive Dissonance

* Question: Have you ever done something stupid to be member of a group?
** Some committed mass suicide, to get a ticket to a new life in paradise in a gigantic spaceship.
** One of them bought a telescope, but wanted to return it because he couldn't see that spaceship.
** Conclusion: The telescope must be broken, because he "knows" the alien spaceship must be there.
** Member's of the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven%27s_Gate_(religious_group)[Heaven's Gate cult], among this particular member, were also pleasant, smart, and reasonable.
* What is the process such fantastic thinking and self-destructive behavior happens?
** An extreme example of a normal human tendency: The need to justify our actions and commitments.

* So what is *cognitive dissonance*, and how do we avoid it to maintain a positive self-image?
* As we saw in link:../ch1-introduction/index.html[chapter 1], self-esteem is our evaluation of our self-worth (we view ourselves as good/competent/decent).
* As we saw in the previous link:../ch5-self/index.html[chapter 5], the function of the self is to maintain our self-esteem.
* It seems that the biggest determinant of our behavior is the motivation to preserve a stable, positive self-image.
* link:../../people/festinger-leon.html[Leon Festinger] developed the most provocative theory in psychology: The theory of cognitive dissonance.

.Cognitive Dissonance
****
The discomfort, felt when our behavior threatens our self-esteem.
****

* Or how Festinger defined it: The discomfort that is caused when two cognitions conflict, or when our behavior conflicts with our attitudes.
** This definition was revised by his student Elliot Aronson: Dissonance is most painful (and most motivated to be reduced) when dissonant cognitions challenge our self-esteem (sense of self-worth).
* How can it be reduced then?
** Changing behavior (align it with the dissonant cognition)
** Changing a dissonant cognition (to justify our behavior)
** Adding new cognitions (also to justify our behavior)
* Take *smoking* for example:
** Imagine you tried, and failed in the past. You might feel bad about yourself.
** To reduce dissonance, change one of your dissonant cognitions: belief that smoking is harmful.
** So now you are free to continue smoking without feeling terrible about it.
** Applying the three strategies above to reduce dissonance and be happy again:
... Stop smoking (change behavior)
... Change cognitions (smoking isn't bad)
... Add consonant cognition (smoking is relaxing)
** Young people tend to justify this by saying things like "smoking is cool", "I want to be like my friends", "in movies, everyone smokes", "I'm healthy; nothing is going to happen to e", "adults are always on my back about stuff I do", or "who wants to be 90 anyway".
** Sometimes people say that it's worth the risk, it's enjoyable, it relaxes them and reduces nervous tension and therefor actually improves their health.

.How to reduce cognitive dissonance
image::images/cognitive_strategies.jpg[Dealing with cognitive dissonance,800,100]

* Once you understood dissonance, you will see it all around you. For example:
** End of the world predictions claim to be accurate, they just used the numbers from the wrong chapter of the bible.
** When central aspects of our identity conflict, as in being gay and Christian. One way is to leave the church or even religion, or to stay and claim "it's not my religion, it's the bigotry of this particular preacher".
* Human thinking is not rational, but rationalizing.
** No matter how smart you are: You will behave irrationally and maladaptively.
** Once we are committed to our views and beliefs, we will distort new information so it will confirm us (see also link:../../phenomena/confirmation_bias.html[confirmation bias]).
** People believing in discredited ideas (vaccines cause autism) or receiving bad news about our health.
** We are very "creative" in denying evidence and reducing discomfort.
** We rationalize our actions, and interpret facts to fit what we already believe.

=== Decisions, Decisions

* With every single decision, we experience a bit of dissonance.
* In the following section you will we see why \...

==== Distorting dis/likes

* When we choose one option, the chosen one is never entirely positive, and the rejected alternative never entirely negative.
* After deciding, we think of ourselves being a smart person, which is dissonant with the negative aspects of your choice; and also with the positive ones of the rejected option.

.Postdecision Dissonance
****
After making a decision, making choice more attractive, and devaluating rejected option.
****

* We make some unconscious mental work to try reducing dissonance, to make us feel better about our decision.

==== Decision Permanence

* The more important the decision is, the greater the dissonance.
* Decisions differ in how permanent they are (how difficult to revoke them).
** If a decision is final, it produces a lot of dissonance.
** E.g. deciding for an education, we inflate positive aspects of it, and minimize those of alternatives.
* Keeping options open makes us less happy, as the finality of decisions actually does.

=== Illusion of Irrevocability

.Lowballing
****
An somewhat unethical strategy (by salespeople) to promise to sell a product for a low price, then claiming there was an error, and gradually increase the price; hoping the customer will still agree.
****

* It works because:
.. Some sort of commitment, by saying yes to the initial (wrong) price. Although sometimes knowing it wasn't a binding contract.
.. Anticipation of an exciting event, due to the commitment; to say no would have meant a big letdown.
.. The new price might be only slightly higher than at other sellers, and justifies his commitment by explaining the already invested effort (e.g. signing the forms).

=== Justification of Effort

* Imagine you put in a lot of effort to get into a particular club.
** Turns out, it's totally worthless. You would feel pretty dumb, right?!
** This will lead to a significant amount of dissonance.
** You might want to convince yourself how nicer, more interesting/worthwhile the club/people are.
** Doing so is possible because activities/behaviors are open to a wide range of possible interpretations.
** If being motivated (reduction of dissonance), we tend to interpret these ambiguities in a positive way.
** And the more effort we put it, the more we will like it; even (especially!) if it's something we don't actually like.

.Justification of Effort
****
Increase liking for something worked hard.
****

* E.g. the harsh training experienced in the army increases group cohesiveness and pride to be a part of this organization.
* If we didn't put any effort in it to get it, and we didn't enjoy it, we see things clearly.
** If there was some sort of severe (effortful/painful) initiation, we convince ourselves it was worthwhile.
** E.g. religious rituals (like the Hindu festival of Thaipusam) convinces people that the greater a men's pain, the greater their commitment to the temple.
* If we _choose_ though to go through a demanding/unpleasant experience, the goal/object becomes more attractive.
** E.g. If you want to join a group, and while walking their you got splashed, your liking towards the group wouldn't change. But if you volunteered to jump into a mud puddle to be admitted to the group, you _would_ like the group better.

=== Counter-attitudinal Behavior

* Imagine your friend bought a product you consider bad but he can't return it anymore.
** You might think something like: "_He seems happy about it, and spent a lot of money for it and can't take it back. If I say what I think, I'll upset him._"
** So you go ahead, and lie (harmony/peace/comfort over truth/honesty/authenticity) and say you like it. You won't feel much dissonance though.
** Your thoughts/values are consistent with this lie.
** It is important not to embarrass or cause pain to people you like, which is an external justification for this harmless lie.

.External Justification
****
Reason/explanation for dissonant personal behavior that's on the outside (reward/punishment).
****

* What if your friend can afford to absorb the costs? Would you still lie?
** If so, then there is no external justification for lying, and you will experience more dissonance.
** If we can't find external, we try to find internal justification.

.Internal Justification
****
Reduction of dissonance by changing yourself (attitude/behavior).
****

* You might try to look harder for something positive about the object.
** As a result, your attitude towards it will be more aligned with your statement/lie.
** Thus: "_Saying becomes believing_."

.Counterattitudinal Behavior
****
Acting against one's own beliefs/attitudes.
****

* Counterattitudinal behavior happens when our behavior conflicts with our private beliefs/attitudes.
** E.g. simply claiming to have an opinion/attitude that differs from our true beliefs.
* Most common experiment is where people getting paid 0/1/20 dollars for doing a boring task and then convincing others that it's great.
** Receiving lots of external justification for lying and not believing it requires no internal justification. Otherwise necessary to convince oneself "why did I do that"?
** Another similar one is: Being bullied by kids, then giving them money for doing so, then gradually decrease the amount, until they stop because they don't get paid doing it anymore.

==== Consequential Issues

* Counterattitudinal behavior toward consequential issues
* It is possible to change people's attitude towards important issues, like prejudice and eating disorders.
** You do so by providing small incentives.
* The media's "thin ideal" leads to unhappiness, constant dieting and eating disorders.
** Creating a dissonance condition, by writing an essay why "thin is beautiful" is unhealthy; the emotional and physical costs pursuing this unrealistic ideal body is irrational.
** People doing this exercise showed significant increase in body satisfaction, decrease in chronic dieting (bulimia risk reduced), and were happier and less anxious.

==== Ben Franklin Effect

* Justifying acts of kindness; see link:../../phenomena/ben_franklin.html[Ben Franklin Effect page]
* Doing a small favor towards a person you don't like, is an example of counterattitudinal behavior.
** Thus, it creates dissonance, and we reduce it by convincing ourselves that we like that person.

==== Justifying cruelty

* Dehumanizing the enemy is a rather universal phenomena.
** We do so by calling them cruel names like: animals, brutes, or other nonhuman creatures.
* Use of such language is to reduce dissonance: "I am a good person, but we are fighting and killing these other people; therefore, they must deserve whatever they get, because they aren't fully human like us."
* Difficult to know whether self-justification can follow acts of cruelty, rather causing them.

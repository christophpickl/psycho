= Conformity and Obedience

* How to influence behavior?
* Remember the "ice bucket challenge" from 2014?
** It was for a guy with Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).
** Challenge a friend and donate 10 USD, otherwise donate 100 USD if you don't do it.
** The video went viral on social media.
* We make every day lots of decisions whether to conform to the behavior of others, or to strike out on an independent path.
** People try to manipulate us, so we do what they want us to do (to conform to their influence).
** Sometimes with a direct request, sometimes with a more subtle process (indirectly indicating what's appropriate).
** Topics such as: clothes, hairstyles, or slang terms.

== When and Why

* Western culture (esp. American) is individualistic, think for yourself, and non-conforming.
** This cultural self-image was shaped by the historical experience with western expansion (Wild West taming).
** Think for example of the "Marlboro Man", the most successful advertising campaign in American history.
* We obviously like to think of ourselves not of spineless, weak conformists, but that we make up our own minds.
** Remember Apple's advertisement slogan "Think different".
* Conforming to an extreme leads to mass suicide; see link:../ch6-justification/index.html[chapter 6 - justification].
* Seemingly ordinary people, when put under social pressure, conform to a surprising degree.
** Take for example the American civil rights movement from 1961.
** They followed Gandhi's principles of nonviolent protest to end segregation.
** A form of passive acceptance of violent treatment; remaining calm in the face of harassment (threats, insult, violence).
** New recruits conformed leading to a contagious commitment to nonviolent protest.
* Social pressure can of course also result in a less heroic (and more immoral) behavior:
** About 500 Vietnamese civilians died when other soldiers joined in the shooting of villagers.
** The abuse of Iraqi captivates at the Abu Ghraib prison in 2003.
** American soldiers urinating on the corpses of Taliban fighters in 2011.
** Or teenage "suicide clusters" when multiple deaths happen in a community in a short period of time.

.Conformity
****
Behavioral change due to real/imagined influence of others.
****

* We alter our behavior to conform to the expectations of others.
* When we are in a confusing/unusual situation and don't know what to do, we use other's behavior as a cue.
** We also don't want to be ridiculed/punished for being different. Being rejected or thought less of by others.

== Informational Social Influence

* The need to know what's "right", and how it motivates us to conform.
* Life is full of ambiguous/confusing situations.
** Then we feel uncertain about what to think/how to act.
* Luckily we have a powerful/useful source of knowledge: behavior of others.
** We often simply watch others, instead of directly asking about the appropriate way to act.
** We believe that others' interpretations is accurate and will help us for appropriate behavior.

.Informational Social Influence
****
Believe that other's interpretation of an ambiguous situation is correct.
****

* An experiment made use of the _autokinetic effect_.
** A visual illusion, when staring at a bright light in a uniformly dark environment (star in dark night).
*** It then appears to waver a bit back/forth, as there is no stable visual reference point; but in reality it doesn't move at all.
*** This autokinetic effect creates an ambiguous situation.
** In the second phase, paired with two other people; now a truly social situation.
*** All three people speak out loud their judgement whether light has moved or not.
*** After several trials with the same group, they converged on a common estimate.
*** Thus, we use each other as a source of information, believing the group estimate is the correct one.

.Private Acceptance
****
Conforming other's behavior, as genuinely belief what they do/say is right.
****

* Informational social influence: We avoid to stand out, to look foolish.
** Because of that, we sometimes conform even though we don't think others are right.

.Public Compliance
****
Conforming other's behavior publicly, without necessarily believing in what they do/say is right.
****

* Interestingly, when the experiment participants were back on their own, they still used the previous group's estimates.
** Thus, we rely on each other to define our reality (even in the later absence of the others).
* Think of the "reuse your bath towels" request in hotels.
** To make it more effective, the sign should say that "the majority of the guests in this very room had reused their towels".
** Instead of the general "help the environment" appeal.

=== Being Accurate

* A study created an ambiguous task: eyewitness identification.
** The participants had to pick a "perpetrator"; but doing it several times.
** The picture of the perpetrator was shown only half a second (to make it difficult and ambiguous).
** Afterward, they had to pick the right one out of a list of four men.
** In the second phase, they were put in a group (with three confederates) which gave, before him, the wrong answer.
** In an A) low-importance condition, people conformed 35% and B) high-importance 50% to the group's judgement.
** Thus: Informational social influence for eyewitness is a bad thing to uncover the truth.
*** And that's why when there are multiple eyewitnesses, the police interviews them individually.

=== When Informational Conformity Backfires

* Informational social influence is especially dramatic during a crisis.
** The person might be ill-equipped to respond, and has no idea what's happening or what to do.
** When one's personal safety is involved, the need for information is acute: And we even stronger look at other's behavior.
* When H.G. Wells science fiction fantasy "War of the Worlds" was broadcast via radio (there was no TV back then), everyone panicked.
** People reinforced each others' sense of panic by responding anxiously.
* In contemporary society, misinformation spreads easily via social media.
** Think about hoaxes, erroneous updates, urban legends, and conspiracy theories.
** Also "fake news", which sometimes is a deliberate thing created or to discredit solid and well-sourced reporting.

=== When we will conform to it

. Ambiguous situation
** When we are unsure of the correct response appropriate behavior, or the right idea.
** The most crucial variable for determining source of information.
** The more uncertain, the more we rely on others.
. During a crisis
** When we don't have time to stop and think.
** When in panic, and uncertain what to do.
** Unfortunately, others we imitate may also panic and behave irrationally.
. Others are experts
** The more expertise/knowledge someone has, the more valuable guid in ambiguous situations.
** However, experts are not always reliable sources of information.
** Imagine calling the police during the "War of the Worlds broadcast incident", and they too think it's real.

== Normative Social Influence

* Or: The need to be accepted.
** Why do we engage in risky behavior?
** Why do we follow a group's lead when the resulting behavior is far from sensible, potentially fatal?
* Because we want to be liked and accepted by others; conforming to a group's social norms.

.Social Norms
****
Implicit/explicit group rules for acceptable behaviors/values/beliefs of its members.
****

* Groups have certain expectations how members should behave.
** If you don't, you are perceived as different, difficult, and deviant.
** In the social media era, these norms are transmitted faster than ever.
* Whatever "goes viral" is what's emotionally arousing.
** Going viral: A dramatic/sudden popularity of certain videos/memes/stories/ideas due to social influence, contagion and conformity.
** The surprise and amusement we experience when someone dumps icy water on himself (and "doing good" by doing so).
** The emotional response can vary from happiness, anger/outrage, to surprise; think of the people freezing in the "mannequin challenge".
** Why do you think has "bottle flipping" became so popular?
* Normative conformity is so powerful because being accepted by others is so incredibly important to us.
** Rejection hurts because we are social animals; being part of the group was relevant for survival most of human history, not only for well-being.
** Being deprived of human contact is stressful, traumatic, and psychologically painful.
* Members going against the flow (being deviant) are being punished, ridiculed, and rejected by other group members.
* An extreme form of this is _hikikomori_: Usually male teenagers from Japan withdrawing from all social interaction, sometimes over decades.
** Those were often victims of severe (cyber)bullying before withdrawal.
** Cyberbullying now affects somewhere between 10-35% of school children globally.
* We conform to gain acceptance, to be not made fun of, getting into trouble, or be ostracized (=geächtet).

.Normative Social Influence
****
Do so others will like/accept me, leading to public conformity with the group's beliefs/behaviors (yet, not always with private acceptance).
****

=== Social Approval

* The "Solomon Asch Line-Judgement" classic studies explored the power of normative social influence.
** People especially conform in highly ambiguous situations; thus, when wholly unambiguous, they shouldn't.
** Instead, resist social pressure to conform and be rational, objective problem-solving.
** Study told participants it's about perceptual judgements; which one out of three, has the closest length to a reference line.
*** It's crystal clear what's the right answer, but there are 7 other participants (actually confederates).
*** The dilemma: The people before the real participant give a wrong answer; will they conform an obvious wrong answer?
*** Answer: yes! They gave 12 out of 18 times the wrong answer to conform. 76% conformed to the wrong answer at least once. On average one third.
** We are afraid of being the lone dissenter (=Andersdenkender), and might arouse anger by standing out, making fool of oneself, although you feel totally right.
** In a variation, people had to write down their answer, thus not having to worry about finding out their answer. Conformity dropped dramatically!
* Normative pressures usually result in _public compliance without private acceptance_.
** We are afraid to look foolish even in front of complete strangers.
** We don't want to risk social disapproval, even from complete strangers.
* Lesson learned: We blindly go along with the group, and turn our backs on reality and truth.
* Under fMRI scans it was shown that giving the right answer (disagreeing with the group) leads to higher activity in the amygdala (negative emotional states, modulating social behavior).

=== Being Accurate?

* In ambiguous situations the more important the decision is, the more we conform to informational reasons.
* In non-ambiguous situations, with an important decision, will we be strong enough, withstand group pressure, and disagree?
** A study showed that with a task where people were 97% correct when being alone ...
*** ... they gave the wrong answer to conform for low-importance things 33%, and for high-importance 16%.
*** Even when the group is wrong and the right answer is obvious, and we have strong incentives to be accurate, we find it still difficult to risk social disapproval (even from strangers).
* We usually don't like to admit it, but we all are affected by normative social influence.
** It reflects a negative stereotype of: to conform one is spineless and weak.
** We tend to underestimate the power of normative social influence.
* This can be taken advantage of if it's well understood by for example:
** Hiring professional laughers at comedy shows, and it will be perceived funnier.
** Sports teams and music bands paying abnormally enthusiastic fans to be in the first row.
* The desire to fit in and be accepted is part of human nature.

=== Consequences of Resisting it

* Violating norms has consequences, and those can be sometimes even entertaining.
** Stand-up routines and contemporary comedians explore taboo topics and embarrassing revelations by violating social norms.
* What happens if you violate them?
** People might get annoyed or even angry at you.
** First, the group will try to bring you "back into the fold", by increased communication (teasing comments, long discussions).
** If that doesn't work, they will say negative about and to you, and ultimately withdraw from you and being rejected.
* In one of Stanley Schachter's experiment, a confederate disagreed with the group's decision.
** The deviant became the target of most comments and questions. Near the end, communication with him dropped sharply.
** They tried to convince him, failed, thus ignored him altogether. In addition, they also punished him.
* Social groups are well versed in how to bring a non-conformist into line.

*Unveiling Normative Social Influence by breaking the rules*

* What are common norms in your culture?
** Have you ever tried to stand on the left side of the escalator?!
** Or reserve a seat in public transportation with a tissue package?!
* Try it yourself: Standing too far/close to a friend during a typical conversation.
** If too close, he will feel uncomfortable and end the conversation sooner, or back up.
** If you're too far, he will come closer.
** By acting in a non-normative/odd way, others try to figure out what's going on and change your behavior.
** If the fail to change you, they will avoid/ignore you.
** Don't forget to *debrief* your friend.
*** Note the relief you feel when revealing it.
** Experience the normative pressure, and the challenge to resist it.
====

=== When we will conform to it

* In Asch's line-judging studies, 75% conformed (25% did never), and 95% disagreed at least once.
** So when are we most likely to conform?
* There seems to be three variables playing a role here according to the social impact theory:

.Social Impact Theory
****
Conforming depends on group's importance/immediacy/size.
****

* The three variables whether we conform to a group are:
.. *Strength*: How important is that group to us?
.. *Immediacy*: How (physically) close are we in space and time to the group?
.. *Number*: What is the group size? (the influencing effect has a logarithmic curve; peak at 3, stable until 7, then decreases even a bit)

==== Group Importance

* Normative pressure increases when it comes from people we are friends with, we love and respect.
** There is a large cost losing this love and respect.
* As a consequence, it's dangerous to have policy decisions made by highly cohesive groups; they care more about pleasing than arriving at the best/most logical decision.
* Yet, individuals can earn the right to deviate occasionally without serious consequences.

.Idiosyncrasy Credits
****
We earn credits (tolerance) from others by conforming; we pay those back when we deviate (and thus not getting "punished").
****

* It's like putting money in the bank to save for future use.
* Having allies in a group also changes the situation drastically:
** Having one ally, helping the line-experiment participant resist normative pressures from 32% (all give wrong answer) to 6% (one gives right answer).

==== Collectivistic Culture

* Society/culture predicts the frequency of normative social influence.
* In Asia/Japan people value more cooperation and loyalty towards groups they belong to/with which they identify.
** Little expectation to conform to strangers, thus during a psychological experiment, they would conform less than US people.
** British people would conform more if they believed others were psychology majors, compared to history majors.
** In Germany, conformity to strangers is less valued than conforming to a few well-defined groups.
* In collectivistic cultures, agreeing is not seen as submissive/cowardice, but as tactful/sensitive, promoting harmony/supportive to relationships.

*Social Norms and Bigotry (=Fanatismus)*

Research on social influence shows: Creating a norm that tolerates/encourages bigotry, allow bigotry to spread.
Maintaining social norms against prejudice means consciously rejecting our own implicit biases.
====

=== Minority Influence

* How could change ever be introduced into a system, if nonconformists are silenced, deviants rejected?
* When the few influence the many:

.Minority Influence
****
When a minority of group members influences the (behavior/beliefs) of the majority.
****

* This happens when the minority expresses a consistent, solid view, the majority will notice/adapt to it.
** E.g. in the 1970s a minority of scientists called attention to human-caused climate change, which is today a majority thing to know.
* Minorities use _informational social influence_ to exert influence on the group.
** Majorities use public compliance because fo _normative social influence_.
** Minorities are persuasive, through private acceptance because of _informational social influence_.

== Conformity Tactics

* Informational messages have little impact on us; but receiving a social message has significantly more impact.
** E.g. during election times, just a conventional sign versus seeing a friend having a "I voted" button on his Facebook page.

=== Role of Injunctive/Descriptive Norms

* Social norms are useful to induce people to conform to positive/socially approved behavior.

.Injunctive Norms
****
Our perception of what behavior is approved/disapproved by others.
****

.Descriptive Norms
****
Our perception how people actually behave, regardless whether approved/disapproved by others.
****

* Think about littering:
** Injunctive Norms: We take into consideration how others might approve (promising rewards) or not (punishment) littering or not.
*** What we _should_ (not) do. Knowing it's wrong.
** Descriptive Norms: Observe how others actually behave, whether they threw their waste on the ground or not.
*** Yet we leave our trash in the seat in the cinema.
* Studies showed through field experiments that we look at other's behavior (descriptive norms) to decide about our own behavior.
** The setup:
*** A confederate walks by, either littering or not in front of you -descriptive norm condition. ("this is what people do in this situation")
*** In the informative norm condition, the confederate picked up waste from the ground. ("littering is wrong")
*** Two different environments: A clean one, and a dirty (heavily littered) one.
*** The participant gets a flyer in their car's windshield; what is he going to do with it? To litter or not?
** The result:
*** Injunctive norms are more effective (than descriptive ones) at changing behavior.
**** They tap into normative conformity: Seeing someone picking up litter, tells us littering is wrong (society disapproves it).
**** It even works better if the "judge" (dis/approving behavior) is someone close to us (family, close friends).
*** Seeing someone throwing garbage on the ground A) if already dirty, it tells us it's ok B) if still clean, it reminds us it's not ok, as it's outstanding behavior.

=== Beware the "Boomerang Effect"

* Using norms to change behavior.
* Trying to change behavior can backfire:
** Your audience is not homogenous, but can be split into two groups:
** 1) Those performing the undesirable behavior at an above-average level (you want to convince them to decrease).
** 2) Those performing it at a below-average level (you want them to continue, rather boomerang by increasing that behavior).
* Experiment: convince people to preserve electricity by giving them information on their thermostat.
** 1) Descriptive norm condition: informed about their energy consumption, and the average.
*** Worked good for people consumed more than above average; boomeranged for others: "If others use electricity like crazy, why should I hold back?!"
** 2) Descriptive norm plus injunctive norm condition: the above, plus smiley if done better (happy) or worse (sad) than the average.
*** Didn't boomerang. Happy smiley face reminded that doing the right thing, and they kept doing it.
** Best thus: Give injunctive norm feedback (smileys), combined with descriptive nor (energy usage information).

=== Other Tactics of Social Influence

* There are many different techniques being used, e.g. when you want to buy a car, join a gym, or negotiate with a salesperson.
** Psychologists observed the master salesperson/marketer/negotiator to catalogue social influence at work.
* Experiment: Put a big, ugly, empty sign in your yard.
** 17% are willing. But once first asked to put a small sign in the window, and then 2 weeks later ask for the big, ugly sign, 76% are willing.

.Foot-in-the-Door Technique
****
Agree first to small request, then more likely agree to large, second request.
****

* Travelling salesman use this, by getting first their foot inside your house, so you can't slam the door.
** Workings: You see yourself as an agreeable person, so you feel committed after agreeing with the first request.
*** To say "no" to a follow-up request could trigger uncomfortable feelings of inconsistency/dissonance.
* Opposite tactic also works:
** First ask a big favor for a much larger commitment, where they will say "no".
** After that, ask for a small one, which seems much smaller to agree to relative to the first request.

.Door-in-the-Face Technique
****
First ask large request, the more likely agree to smaller, second request.
****

* Experiment: Ask people to spend 2 hours cleaning the zoo; only 17% agree.
** Alternative: Ask first to commit to volunteer weekly for 2 years (everyone refused), and THEN ask for a single 2 hours cleaning; 50% agreed.
** Explanation: The first request make the second one seem less daunting by comparison.
*** Seems like they negotiate, let go/sacrificed a bit, and now you try to meet them halfway.
* Do you recognize those strategies in your own life? To manipulate others? Look out for others using them on you.

.Propaganda
****
Systematic attempt to manipulate the mass.
****

* Propaganda is, as the Nazi regime used it, the deliberate, systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist.
** It is most successful if it taps into pre-existing beliefs.
** It operates in the form of persuasive messages leading to attitude change.
** Also influenced socially, through informational conformity.
*** When experiencing a crisis, we are more likely to conform.
** You were considered a "good" Nazis, if you would spy on your own parents and report them to the Gestapo (if being disloyal).
** A typical example of normative conformity, where public compliance can occur even without private acceptance.

[NOTE.test,caption=REVIEW QUESTIONS]

====

== Obedience to Authority

.Obedience
****
Change your behavior because of the influence of an authority.
****

* There was once a fast-food restaurant hoax, which lead ordinary people following orders from a complete strange, to humiliate and abuse an innocent teenager.
* We are socialized to obey authorities we perceive as legitimate.
* We internalize this norm, even when the authority isn't present.
** E.g. we stop at red lights, even if cops/parents are not around.
* Small things seem not to be a bad thing, but can have tragic consequences too.

=== The Milgram Study

* Everywhere we still have lots of atrocities (=Gräueltaten) and genocides.
* Where does the role played by social influence end, and personal responsibility begin?
** Were Holocaust participants total sadists/psychopaths or simply ordinary citizens subjected to complex/powerful social pressures?
** The point is not to excuse those people; but it's too easy to explain their behavior as an act of a madman.
** It is more fruitful (and frightening) to view them as ordinary people exposed to extraordinary social influence.
* link:../../people/milgram-stanley.html[Stanley Milgram] is known for his most famous studies in social psychology.
** The study:
*** Participants are being "tricked" in a fake teacher-learner experiment; the learner is a confederate.
*** It is pretended that it is about a memory test, everytime the learner got it wrong, the participant has to deliver an electric shock.
*** Pretended purpose is: examine the effects of punishment on learning.
*** Each electric shock increases by 15 volts (after each mistake), starting by 15 until 450 (labeled "Danger: Severe Shock).
*** The participant hears the learners screams via an intercom, first a painful "Ugh!", then a "That's all, get me out of here!".
*** The experimenter firmly asks the participant to continue delivering shocks, despite the objections of the learner.
** The result:
*** People would estimate that less than 1% would deliver extreme shocks...
*** 60% went all the end of 450-volt. The average maximum was 360.
*** 80% continued after hearing that the learner had a heart condition, screaming: "Let me out of here! My heart's bothering me."
** Men and women were nearly identically obedient.

=== Role of Normative Social Influence

* It's difficult to refuse normative pressure; when someone wants us to do something, difficult to say "no".
** Especially difficult if the request comes from an authority.
** Participants were afraid that if they would refuse, the experimenter would be disappointed, or even angry; putting pressure on them.
* Unlike the Asch experiment, in this case the experimenter actively attempted the participants to conform.
* Interestingly also to note that the context plaid a significant role.
** E.g. the location (lab vs office), the proximity of the experimenter (local, remote) and the learner (via intercom, or put his hand on a shock plate), possible supporters (who also rebel).
** Especially seeing others disobey made it much easier to disobey too (only 10% gave the maximum shock).
*** Similar to Asch's finding: People conformed way less if only one other person went against the majority.

=== Role of Informational Social Influence

* The participants were always free to get up and leave at any time, and the experimenter was a total stranger.
* People use others to help define the situation, if the circumstances are confusing and unsure what to do.
** Informational social influence especially powerful in an ambiguous situation, a crisis, when others have more expertise than us.
** We identify experts e.g. when they look for scientific by wearing a white lab coat ("they must know, they do the right thing").
*** If the other person looks casual as us (no more knowledgeable), he is less likely used as a source of information on how to respond.
* If there were two experimenters which would disagree whether to continue or not, people would break out of their obedient role.
** Stop obeying when the authorities' definition became unclear.

=== Other Reasons Why We Obey

==== Adhering the Wrong Norm

* When there is a web of conflicting norms, it's difficult to determine which one to follow.
* It was perfectly reasonable to adhere to the norm: "Obey the expert, he is a legitimate authority."
** Participants believed that they were doing something good in the name of science.
* The rules of the game changed slowly and steadily (inflicting severe pain), yet it was difficult to change in the middle, once following a norm.
* The experiment was also very fast-paced, so participants couldn't reflect on what they were doing.
** They were busy recording the learner's response (on the fake memory test).
** If they had been allowed to take a break in a room by themselves, they would have successfully redefined the situation and refused to continue.

==== Self-Justification

* The shocks were given in very small increments, reducing dissonance, and so the decision was fully justified.
* Difficult where to draw the line and stop.
* 215 volts is not _that_ different from 200, and 230 is not _that_ different from 215.
* The incremental nature was essential to the level of obedience.
* Similar to the foot-in-the-door technique; incrementally increasing series of requests.

==== Loss of Personal Responsibility

* When we want to become members of a group, and experience an initial, embarrassing/degrading act, how can we now say no to the next request?!
* We become the "puppet", we are not responsible, as "it was their idea", and we were "simply following orders".
* The loss of a sense of personal responsibility is a critical component in obedience.
** We offload personal responsibility to someone else.
** E.g. a prison guard executing a death sentence, reducing his cognitive dissonance (immoral act of killing vs. obeying the law) by engaging in self-justification.

=== Obedience Studies, Then and Now

* Milgram's work was done in the 1960s and was replicated in 11 countries, involving about 3,000 participants.
** Yet, it ignited a lot of protest (and soul-searching) about the ethical treatment of those participants.
* Reasons being:
** The use of deception.
** The fact that there was no fully informed consent.
** The use of psychological distress.
** No clarity about the right to withdraw (the opposite was the case, by saying "you have to continue").
** Experience of inflicted insight after the study (people learned unpleasant things about themselves they had not agreed to beforehand).
** Improper debriefing, as some participants were unaware about the confederates, and that the shocks had been fake.
* Because of formalized ethical guidelines established in the meantime, it got increasingly challenging to reproduce obedience research.
** Such studies as Milgram did them could never be run again.
* Yet, they were reproduced ethically and found no significant different in obedience rates between then and now.
** A Poland study showed that 90% of their participants were obedient; similar to Milgram's 82.5% finding who went up to 150-volt.
* Science has sometimes two competing aims: to discover new knowledge and to do no harm.

== Summary

* Conformity definition and why it occurs.
** Conform occurs when we change our behavior, due to real/imagined influence of others.
** Why? Informational or normative social influences.
* How _informational social influence_ motivates us to conform.
** Or: The need to know what's "right".
** Occurs when we don't know the correct/best action to take.
** We look at the behavior of others as a source of information.
** Usually results in _private acceptance_ (we genuinely believe in what others are doing/saying).
** When we want to be *accurate*, we are more likely to conform through informational social influence.
** We are more likely to conform in an *ambiguous* situation, in a *crisis* or if *experts* are present.
** It can obviously *backfire* if others are wrong about what's going on.
* How normative social influence motivates us to conform.
** Through _normative social influence_, or: The need to be accepted.
** We change our behavior to adapt to that of others, because we want to ...
*** have a good standing.
*** stay members of that group.
*** continue to gain the advantages of membership.
** We conform to _social norms: implicit/explicit rules for acceptable behaviors/values/attitudes.
** Usually leads to public, but not private acceptance.
** Sub-points:
*** *Social approval* int the Asch Line-Judgement studies (conform even if obviously wrong; peer pressure).
*** When being *accurate* is that important, that we resist normative social influence (go against the group).
*** Consequences of *resisting*: Ridicule, ostracism, and rejection by the group.
*** When to conform: According to _social impact theory_, depending on strength/immediacy/size of the group.
**** More likely to conform when: care about the group, members are unanimous (=unison) in thoughts/behaviors, 3+ members, and in collectivist culture.
**** Conformity gives us _idiosyncrasy credits_, allowing to deviate without consequences.
*** Minority influence: For that to be possible to happen, the presentation of the minority's viewpoint must be consistent.
* How we can use the knowledge of social influence. Conformity tactics:
** Communicating _injunctive norms_ (expectation what's approved behavior) more powerful than _descriptive norms_ (expectation what's actual behavior).
** Boomerang effect: Make undesirable behavior more likely than it was.
** Marketing strategies:
*** _Foot-in-the-door technique_: First small request, then bigger (more likely to say yes).
*** _Door-in-the-face technique_: First large request, rejected, then small request (negotiating, reciprocity).
*** Propaganda also works on that level.
* Studies showing our willingness to obey authorities: The Stanley Milgram study.
** Response to an authority figure, giving potentially lethal shocks.
** _Normative pressure_ makes it difficult to stop obeying authority figures.
*** We want to please the authority, doing a good job ("good boy").

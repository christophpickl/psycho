= The Self

"_Understanding ourselves in a social context._"

* Remember Mowgli, from "The Jungle Book"?
** Some aspects of this fiction are true, considering abandoned children adopted by animals.
** How does being raised by animals shape a human being?
** What about their sense of self? How do they define themselves?
** Something basic like our self-concept is profoundly influenced by interactions with other people.

== Origins and Nature of Self-Concept

* Who are you, the thing you call "myself"?
* We are the only species that has a "self".
** Doubtful that other animals can do it the way we can do it.
** Still, there is at least a rudimentary sense of self
* The link:../../phenomena/mirror_test.html[mirror test]:
** Anesthetize an animal, paint a red dot on it's face, put it in front of a mirror.
** A great ape will immediately touch itself there, a lesser ape not.
** The identify (or not) that the image in the mirror is themselves.
** Other animals were not able to do that.
* Humans develop that skill at about 2 years old.
** After some time, it will develop into a full blown self-concept.

.Self-Concept
****
Set of beliefs about our personal attributes.
****

* When being asked "Who are you?" the answer depends on age:
** A child refers to clear-cut, easily observable characteristics (age, sex, neighborhood, hobbies).
** A mature person uses less physical, but more psychological states (thoughts/feelings) and how others judge us.

  I am a human being... I am a moody, serious person. I am an insecure person. I am an ambitious person. I am a very curious and conscientious.  I am a loner. I am an introvert. I am a thinker. I am neither left or right. I am an opportunitist and eclecticist. I am spiritual. I am not a classifiable person (i.e., I don't want to be).

* When we grow older, and we change, how much will that impact our selves?
** According to surveys, morality (racist, cruel) impacts our true self than changes in perceptual abilities (e.g. changes in vision).
** When a person used to be kind and is now cruel (or egalitarian and now racist), we hardly recognize them.
** Thus: *Morality* is central to the self-concept, more than cognitive processes/desires.

=== Cultural Influences

* Considering the case of the crown princess of Japan.
** She gave up her career and her independent life, to serve the prince.
** What you think about this, depends on the culture you grew up in.
** In Western cultures, we have an independent view of the self.

.Independent View of the Self
****
Defining oneself through own, internal thoughts/feelings/actions (and not of those of others).
****

* Thus, we in the West might think she was forced by a backward, sexist society.
** Yet, in the East, they have cultural interdependence (instead of our independence of the self).

.Interdependent View of the Self
****
Defining oneself through relationships; our behavior is determined by other's thoughts/feelings/actions.
****

* They value connectedness, interdependence, over independence and uniqueness.
* What is viewed as positive/normal behavior differs based on the culture.
** Because of that, it has consequences for communication between cultures.
** It is difficult to appreciate each other.
* We see, the conception of the self is a social construct (and differs by culture).

=== Functions of the Self

* It has four main functions:
[arabic]
.. *Self-Knowledge*: Understanding who we are (and how we formulate/organize this)
.. *Self-Control*: Planing/executing decisions
.. *Impression Management*: Presenting ourselves to others
.. *Self-Esteem*: Positive views of ourselves

== Self-Knowledge

* How we use introspection, observation of own behavior, and how we know ourselves.
* Who are we, and why do we do what we do?

=== Introspection

.Introspection
****
Process to look inward, examine own thoughts/feelings/motives.
****

*  Introspection means to look inward, examine the "inside information".
** Information only we alone have, about our thoughts/feelings/motives.
** It's not perfect, as not always pleasant, and also hidden from conscious awareness.

The following two sub-sections contain consequences and limits of self-introspection.

==== Self-Awareness Theory

.Self-Awareness Theory
****
Evaluate/compare our behavior to our internal standards/values.
****

[#img-self-awareness]
.Self-Awareness Theory: The consequences of Self-Focused Attention
image::images/self-awareness.jpg[Self-Awareness Theory,800,100]

* Sometimes we naturally put our focus on and think about ourselves.
* The self-awareness theory says, that when we focus on ourselves, we evaluate/compare our current behavior to our internal standards/values.
** We become self-conscious, meaning:
*** We become objective/judgmental observers of ourselves.
*** We see ourselves as an outside observer would.
* We might see then a disparity (discrepancy) between behavior and internal standards.
** Being confronted with disagreeable feedback about ourselves leads to discomfort (happens often).
** There is a correlation between being self-aware and bad mood even!
* When we are in a negative state of self-awareness, we tend to escape it, by avoidance.
** Substance abuse, binge eating, and sexual masochism; effective/dangerous means to turn off one's internal spotlight.
** Less dangerous: religion/spirituality to avoid self-focus.
* If we just succeeded in something, focusing on oneself can be pleasant.
* It's also useful to keep us from trouble, by reminding us what's right/wrong.
** There's a correlation between self-awareness and following moral standards (e.g. cheating).
** It helps us to resist that little devil on our shoulder, pushing us into temptations, and make us aware of our morals/ideals.
* Self-awareness is aversive if it reminds us of our shortcomings.

[NOTE.tryit,caption=TRY IT]
====
*Measuring Self-Consciousness*

How much do you focus on yourself when you are alone? Answer the following questions with 1 (not at all like me) to 5 (very much like me), to figure out how consistent your tendency to be self-aware is.

1. I'm always trying to figure myself out.
2. Generally, I'm not very aware of myself.
3. I reflect about myself a lot.
4. I'm often the subject of my own fantasies.
5. I never scrutinize (=examine) myself.
6. I'm generally attentive to my inner feelings.
7. I'm constantly examining my motives.
8. I sometimes have the feeling that I'm off somewhere watching myself.
9. I'm alert to changes in my mood.
10. I'm aware of the way my mind works when I work through a problem.

Scoring instructions:

[hiddenAnswer]#Reverse answers to question 2 and question 5 (1 becomes 5, 2 becomes 4, ...). Sum all 10 scores; the higher, the more likely you are to focus your attention on yourself. An average score of 26 was achieved by some college students.#
====

==== Self-Made Explanations

* Judging why we feel the way we do; and by this, telling more than we can know.
* Another function of introspection is to figure out _why_ we feel the way we do; not an easy task.
* The ancient Greeks thought that love was a sickness.
** But still: What causes you to feel this way?
* We are usually aware of the final result of our thought process (e.g. that we are in love).
** We are often unaware of the cognitive processing that led to the result.
** We are always able to come up with an explanation.
** We often "tell more than we can know"; our explanations go beyond what we can reasonably know.
* For example, predicting one's own mood. An experiment \...
** Amount of sleep is unrelated to our mood.
** Friends are a good predictor of our mood instead.
* There are many theories what influences our feelings/behavior. Explaining the why.
** Most of these theories come from our culture. Using schemas.

.Causal Theories
****
Theories learned from culture about what causes our feelings/behaviors.
****

* Those are not always correct, and lead to incorrect judgements about the causes of our actions.
* They often yield the wrong answer about why we feel the way we do.

=== Self-Observation

* Knowing ourselves by observing our own behavior.

==== Self-Perception Theory

* We use observations (of own behavior) to determine how we feel.

.Self-Perception Theory
****
When attitudes/feelings are uncertain/ambiguous, we infer those by self-observation (including the situation).
****

* We do so only if we are not sure how we feel.
* We then judge whether our behavior reflects how we feel, or the situation made us act that way.
* We use the same attributional principles to infer our own attitudes/feelings.

==== Two-Factor Theory of Emotion

* It's about understanding our emotions.
* How do we know which emotion we are experiencing? Labelling it.
* May sound silly, but sometimes we don't know exactly how we feel without thinking about it.
* Experiencing emotions is similar to the whole self-perception process.
* link:../../people/schachter_stanley.html[Stanley Schachter] developed theory of emotion.
** The way we infer our emotional state, same process we infer what kind of people we are/what we are like.
** First we observe our behavior, then we explain the why to ourselves.
** We might feel aroused, and try to find out the cause of it.
** E.g. your heart is pounding, a bit sweaty; in love, or just went for a run?
** His theory is called the two-factory theory of emotion.

.Two-Factor Theory of Emotion
****
Two-step self-perception process: First experience physiological arousal, then seek an explanation.
****

* We use information in the situation, to help make an attribution why we feel aroused.
* E.g. we feel our body in an aroused state (feeling warm, hands shaky, heart-rate increased) but don't know why at first.
** We look for cues in our environment:
*** Bear -> fear
*** Attractive person -> love/lust
*** Exam book -> anxiety
*** At the gym -> it's not an emotion
* Emotions are arbitrary, depending on the most plausible explanation.
** Schachter and Singer experiment (one of the most famous experiment in social psychology):
*** Prevent people from getting angry by providing a non-emotional explanation.
*** We can make them have different emotions by providing different explanations.
*** Emotions can be result of self-perception process.
*** Finding explanation for arousal can be wrong, thus emotion can be mistaken.
*** We rely on situational cues to explain our behavior.

===== Addition: Other Theories of Emotion

* Common sense: event -> emotion -> arousal
** "I tremble because I feel afraid."
* James-Lange: event -> arousal -> interpretation -> emotion
** "I feel afraid because I tremble."
* Cannon-Bard: event -> arousal/emotion
** "That thing makes me tremble and feel afraid."
* Schachter-Singer: event -> arousal -> reasoning -> emotion
* Schachter-Singer's Two-Factory: event -> arousal -> cognitive labels -> emotion
** "I label my trembling as fear, because I appraise the situation as dangerous."

Categories for theories of emotion:

* Physiological: responses within the body cause emotions
* Neurological: brain activity causes emotional responses
* Cognitive: thoughts form emotions

==== Misattribution of Arousal

* In daily life, there are many possible explanations of what caused a certain emotion.
** Difficult to say which cause is how likely.

.Misattribution of Arousal
****
Wrong inferences about what causes us to feel in a certain way.
****

* Famous field experiment by Donald Dutton and Arthur Aron:
** An attractive young woman asks men to fill out a questionnaire.
** She writes down her name and phone number.
** How attracted where these men to her? Would they call her?
*** We might guess whether they are already in a relationship, or how busy they were...
*** Or what's actually going on: Depending on how they interpreted any bodily symptoms.
** One group had to cross a suspension bridge, a scary experienced; after that the woman approached them.
** Another condition, the men could rest for a while after the bridge crossing, to calm down.
** Men mistakenly thought that the physical arousal they experienced came from attraction to the woman, instead of crossing the bridge.
** Next time you encounter an attractive person, and your heart goes crazy, think carefully: you might fall in love for the wrong reasons!
* We learn about ourselves by observing our behavior and conditions where that behavior occurs.
** Observations outward (e.g. free choice in doing some activity) and as well inwards (bodily responses).

[#img-misattribution-arousal]
.When we are aroused (by crossing a bridge), we often attribute that arousal to the wrong source, such as attraction to the person we are with.
image::images/misattribution_arousal.jpg[Misattribution of Arousal,340,100]

==== Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation

* When we perform a certain activity, do we do it because we are intrinsically interested or because we want to gain something (e.g. money)?
* Motivations are an interested and important field of research for many domain, including education.
** You might think that rewarding students for achievements is a good idea.
** There is no doubt rewards are powerful; _positive reinforcements_ to increase frequency.
** BUT: People are not rats! We have more inside going on: thoughts, self-concept, motivation to read in the future.
** If getting rewarded doing something, does it change the reason _why_ we are doing it?
** Once the reward ends, we are less likely to do it than before the reward started.
*** Especially true if we liked doing it already before.

.Intrinsic Motivation
****
Engage in activity because we enjoy it/find it interesting.
****

* The reason to engage in an activity has to do with ourselves.
** We do it because of enjoyment and pleasure.
** We consider it as play, not as work.

.Extrinsic Motivation
****
Engage in activity because of external rewards/pressure.
****

* Once we get rewards, things change in a bad way \...
* According to self-perception theory, we assume that we are motivated by the rewards.
** We lose interest in activities we initially enjoyed.
** Examples are: school, professional athletes, \...

.Overjustification Effect
****
Think that our behavior is caused by extrinsic, and underestimate the intrinsic reasons.
****

* How to protect intrinsic motivation from a reward system?
** There are conditions to avoid this effect: Rewards will undermine interest ONLY if interest was initially high.
** When interest is low (or not existing) at the beginning, then there is nothing to undermine; go ahead and reward.
* Types of rewards make a difference: task-contingent and performance-contingent.

.Task-Contingent Rewards
****
Rewards given, regardless of performance.
****

.Performance-Contingent Rewards
****
Rewards based on performance on task.
****

* It's better to reward for performance, instead of sole participation.
** But: They can backfire if overused: Put pressure, feeling evaluated (lower performance and intrinsic interest).
** Solution: Convey positive feedback without pressuring, making feel nervous.
* Also: Seems to be better to praise hard work, rather personality (e.g. intelligence).

==== Mindsets and Motivation

* Our self-perception influences our motivations by the way we perceive our abilities.
** Are those abilities set in stone (fixed) or can they change (growth)?
** This will determine success in life in general for any ability.
** Setback in sports, education, personal relationships... find a new strategy, rather think that you "don't have what it takes".
* Yet, for already high performing people, which mindset being used makes little difference.

.Fixed Mindset
****
Abilities are unchangeable.
****

* Set amount of an ability; cannot change.
* E.g. intelligence, athletic ability, musical talent, ...
* Those people more likely give up after a setback.

.Growth mindset.
****
Achievement because of hard work.
****

* Result because of:
.. Hard work; years of training/practice; repetition; effort, discipline, power of will.
.. Trying/developing new strategies; find new paths/solutions.
.. Seek input from others; help and advice from others which are already there (experts).
* Those people view setbacks as opportunities to improve through hard work.
* Anything is possible, if right strategy is found and hard work invested.
* They accomplish far more in life.

=== Knowing Myself through Others

* Using other people to know ourselves.
** Self-concept is shaped by people around us (not in solitary context).
* If raised as a feral/wild child by animals, own image would be blurred.
** We wouldn't be able to see ourselves as having selves distinct from others.
* Remember the "red-dye test"?
** Chimpanzees raised with social contact passed it.
** Chimps raised in total isolation didn't react to their reflections at all; no development of a sense of self.

==== Knowing ourselves by Comparison

* How do we use others to define ourselves?
** Measure our own abilities/attitudes and comparing them to others.

.Social Comparison Theory
****
Learn about our abilities/attitudes by comparing ourselves to others.
****

* It was originally formulated by link:../../people/festinger-leon.html[Leon Festinger].
* Two important questions:
.. When do we engage in social comparison? => When there is no objective standard; uncertain about ourselves.
.. With whom do we choose to compare ourselves with? => Depends whether goal is to be accurate or to feel better.

.Upward Social Comparison
****
Comparing us with someone better (trait/ability).
****

* Good if you want to know what excellence is, aspire to the top level.
* But: This can be dispiriting, making us feel inferior.

.Downward Social Comparison
****
Comparing us with someone worse (trait/ability).
****

* Good if you want to feel good about yourself, ego boost.
* Or simply compare ourselves with our past selves (performance); most likely feel better about ourselves (downward comparison).
* The nature of our goals, determine with whom we compare ourselves to.
** Accuracy: similar people.
** Striving: upward comparison.
** Feel better: less fortunate ones (past selves).

==== Knowing Ourselves by Adopting to Other's View

* We use others as a measuring stick, to asses our own abilities.
* Those "others" are mostly our friends.
** Those who hang out together, tend to see the world in the same way.
** Because "birds of a feather flock together"; that's why people holding common views.
** Meaning: People with similar views are attracted to each other. More likely to become friends.
* We also _adopt_ our views of people we hang out with.
** The "_looking-glass self_": We see ourselves and the social world, through eyes of others, and often adopt those views.
** Especially true if we want to get along with each other.
** E.g.: Your best friend mentions he thinks that TV show XY is the best, you will probably like it as well.

.Social Tuning
****
We adopt another person's attitude.
****

* This can happen even when we meet someone for the first time (not a long-lasting, best friend), _if_ we want to get along with them.
* This can very much also happen unconsciously.
* Most of the times, we adopt the views of people we like, and reject the views of people we don't like.

== Self-Control

* "_The executive function of the self._"
* When do we succeed/fail at self-control?!

.Self-Control
****
To subdue immediate desires for long-term goals.
****

* The self's function is to set goals and make choices.
* We are the only species that can imagine events which have not yet happened; use long-term planning.
* Easy when goal is clear, and easy to achieve.
** Hard, because need to avoid short-term pleasures.
** Difficult to achieve (change habits; stick to a diet).
* Strategies that _don't_ work:
** The more try not to think about something, the more those very thoughts keep coming to mind.
** Simply focus on the long-term goal, and how important it is to us.

.Implementation Intentions
****
Plan where/when/how fulfill goal and avoid temptations.
****

* Strategies that _do_ work:
** Make a plan: form specific implementation intentions; how we use self-control in tempting situation to overcome obstacles.
*** "If-then"-format; how/when to do something to get it; how avoid temptations
** Arrange environment to avoid temptations in the first place
*** E.g.: change friends, places to be, shopping list for groceries, turn off phone/computer, use hand-written notes, ...
** Stay well-rested, as self-control requires energy (this is still a bit controversial though).
*** Some replications failed for this "depletion effect"; stay tuned.
** Believe in yourself: If you think it's an unlimited resource, you will be better off (instead easily depleted, limited resource).

== Impression Management

* "_All the world's a stage._"
* Or: How we portray ourselves so that others will see us as we want to be seen.

.Impression Management
****
The attempt to get others see us the way we want to be seen.
****

* We put our best foot forward, to be liked by other; posting pretty pictures of us; draw attention with clever posts.
* We are all like stage actors, trying to convince the "audience" (the people around us), that we are a certain way (even if we are not).

=== Ingratiation and Self-Handicapping

* Two strategies of impression management are: Ingratiation and self-handicapping.

.Ingratiation
****
Make ourselves likeable (by flatter/praise) to others (often of higher status).
****

* We can ingratiate through compliments, by agreeing with someone's ideas, or by commiserating (=mitleidig) and offering sympathy.
* From the other end: We all of course enjoy having someone be nice to us.
* It can backfire though, if the other senses that we are being insincere.

.Self-Handicapping
****
Creating obstacles/excuses for ourselves, so if doing poorly we can avoid blame.
****

* Doing poorly/failing at a task is damaging to our self-esteem.
* Even simply doing less than expected/did in the past, can be upsetting, even if the performance was good itself.
* To prevent disappointment, we set up excuses before the task, just in case.
* If we fail, we have an excuse ready to offer others to explain our poor performance; deflecting potential negative internal attribution.
* Two ways of self-handicapping:
** 1. Behavioral self-handicapping
*** More extreme form; reduce chance to actually succeed; obstacles to blame, instead one's ability.
*** E.g. by using drugs, reduced effort, or failure to prepare for an important event.
*** Men are more likely to engage in it.
** 2. Reported self-handicapping
*** Less extreme form; create ready-made excuses in case we fail.
*** E.g. by complaining we don't feel well, test anxiety, bad moods, physical symptoms.
*** We might believe our own excuses and put less effort on the task.
*** Why work hard when going to do poorly anyway?!
*** It may prevent unflattering attributions for failure, but it has the perverse effect of causing what we are so much afraid of.
*** It has the potential for being disliked by peers as a side effect.
*** Women are particularly critical of others who self-handicap, as they value trying hard to achieve something.

=== Culture, Impression Management, and Self-Enhancement

* All cultures are concerned with impression; they differ in nature of this concern, and strategies being used.
* E.g. In interdependent asian cultures like in Japan, people are concerned having the "right" guests at their wedding and sometimes even rent mourners for funerals.

== Summary

* The self-concept and how it develops
** Origins and nature of self-concept
*** Great (not lesser) apes (e.g. chimps) rudimentary sense of self (pass mirror self-recognition test)
*** Humans develop self-recognition with 2 years; later full-blown self-concept (set of beliefs about personal attributes).
*** We think morality is more central to self-concept than cognitive processes/desires.
** Cultural influences
*** West independent view of self, East interdependent one.
** Functions
*** Self-knowledge; who are we
*** Self-control; make plans, execute decisions
*** Self-esteem; feel about ourselves
*** Impression Management; present ourselves to others
* How we use introspection, observations of our own behavior, or other people to know ourselves
** Self-knowledge: how to know who we are, and why we do what we do
** Self-knowledge through introspection
*** Learn about own feelings/motives/emotions
*** Self-awareness theory: focus on self, evaluate/compare behavior with internal standards/values
*** Explaining why feel the way we do, using (culturally based) causal theories
** Self-knowledge by observation own behavior
*** Self-perception theory: attitudes/feelings are uncertain/ambiguous, infer by self-observation and context
*** Two-factor theory of emotion: first experience arousal, then seek explanation (sometimes wrong: misattribution of arousal)
*** Overjustification effect: focus extrinsic, underestimate intrinsic reasons
*** Fixed (abilities can't change) vs growth mindset (abilities are malleable; can cultivate/grow)
** Self-knowledge using others
*** Social comparison theory: Own abilities/attitudes by comparing with others
*** Social tuning: Adopt attitudes those we like/want to interact with.
* Compare when we succeed/fail at self-control
** Self-control: the executive function of the self
** Exerting energy on one tasks, limits to exert self-control on other task
** Simply believing willpower is infinite already helps (also prayers help!)
* How we portray ourselves so others will see us, the way we want them to see us
** Impression management: All the world's a stage.
*** We want others to see us the way we want them.
** Strategy: Ingratiation; flattery/praise to make likable to others
** Strategy: Self-handicapping; create obstacles/excuses, when fail, avoid blame oneself
** Culture: all have it, yet kinds of images we want to present, are culture-dependant

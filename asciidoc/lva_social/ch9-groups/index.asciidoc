= Group Processes

* Have you ever (anonymously) posted something online you would have never said in real to a person?
* Make groups of experts better decisions than individuals?
** Combined experts should inevitably lead to the best decision...
** But that's not necessarily true: The nature of groups influence people's behavior.

== Group Definition

* What are groups and why do we join them?

.Group
****
Two or more people interacting who are "interdependent": needs/goals causes them to influence each other.
****

* Interdependent here means: You influence them, and they influence you.
* Groups consist of people who have assembled for a common purpose.
* Six students studying independently in a library are _not_ a group.
** But if they meet to study together, they are.
* If a group only consists of 2 people, it's usually called a _dyad_ instead.

=== Why we join groups

* Fulfills a number of basic human needs; so basic, that there may be an innate need to belong to a group.
** In our evolutionary past, it was a substantial survival advantage.
** Get (hunt/grow) more food, find mates, and care for children.
** Across all cultures, we form relationships, monitor their status in groups, and remain vigilant if they might get rejected.
** Also, the need to feel distinctive from those who do _not_ belong to the same groups.
** Especially small groups can give us both: sense of belonging and making us feel special (clubs, art organizations).
* Important part of our (social) identity; helping us define who we are.
** People are a good source of information to resolve ambiguity.
** Think of people wearing clothes with the name of one of their groups (sports team, university, ...).
* Source of social norms; explicit/implicit rules defining what's acceptable behavior.
* Helping us to accomplish our goals which we wouldn't be able to do on our own otherwise.
** Accomplish objectives, otherwise difficult/impossible to meet individually.
** E.g. moving to another apartment is much quicker and less painful with the help of others.

=== Composition and Function

* Most groups have 3-6 members.
** If bigger, we cannot interact with all members anymore.

==== Social Norms

* Define behaviors which are acceptable, and all members are expected to obey (e.g. being quiet in the library).
* Some vary from group to group (e.g. what clothes to wear at weddings vs funerals).
* The power becomes clear once we violate them: shunned and pressured to leave the group.

==== Social Roles

.Social Roles
****
Shared expectations how particular people are supposed to behave.
****

* Norms specify how _all_ have to behave, roles are only for certain positions.
** They are helpful because so we know what to expect from each other.
** When the roles are clearly defined, we are satisfied and perform well.
* In extreme cases, we lose our personalities if getting too far into a role.
** Think of Zimbardo's (controversial) study to mock a prison at Stanford University's basement, the so-called link:../../phenomena/stanford_prison_experiment.html[Stanford Prison Experiment].
** The source of evil, in prisons where there is secrecy and no accountability, allowing people to do things they would ordinarily not do.
* Zimbardo's prison study and Milgram's obedience study shows us that most of us would not fully resist.
** The social influences in these powerful situations would make us perform acts we thought never being capable of.

==== Group Cohesiveness

.Group Cohesiveness
****
Qualities that bind group members together, promote mutual liking.
****

* If a group was formed for social reasons (friends), then the more cohesion the better.
** The more cohesive, the more likely members stay, take part in group activities, and recruit new like-minded members.
* If a group was formed for work/solve problems (military, sales) things are more complicated...
** Doing well on a task, leads to more cohesion, but not necessarily the other way round.
** Cohesiveness causes a group to perform well only if the task requires close cooperation.
** It will get in the way, if good relations are more important than finding good solutions.

==== Group Diversity

* A group's composition is also defined by its diversity: age, sex, beliefs, and opinions.
* Two reasons for the homogeneity of groups:
** Similarity attracts ("birds of a feather flock together" as in the English proverb).
** Groups tend to operate in ways that encourage similarity.
* We tend to gravitate toward groups with similar others, and such similarity predicts group cohesiveness.
* Homogeneous groups are often cohesive, thus they like their fellow group members more if all the same, than if members are diverse.
* Cohesive doesn't mean it is performing at its optimal level though!
** Diverse groups (race, experience, education, attitude) can come up with more feasible and effective possibilities.
** Diversity can come at the expense of cohesiveness and morale, yet leads to improved creativity, information sharing, and flexible problem-solving.
** The friction caused by diversity can upend conformity and improve decision-making.

*Cooperative and Corruptive Tendencies*

* East Asian countries are more cooperative but also have more corruption.
** With cultural norms like respecting collective goals, they are more susceptible to corruption requests.
** They prioritize collective goals and relational concerns; corruption that is collaborative in nature.
* Social norms and interdependence of roles influence (un)ethical behaviors.
* People engage more in dishonest conducts following their ingroup members.
* Due to Asian's relational concerns, they more often imitate behaviors.
* It's really a problem, as: "A bad apple spoils the bunch."

== Individual Behavior Within

* The question is, how we perform differently when others are around us.
** The effects of being in a group on the performance of individual  people.
* Do we act differently? Like when we "choke" under the pressure of people watching us?
* Under which circumstances do they increase/decrease our performance?

=== Social Facilitation

* Others being present can mean A) doing the same thing with others, or B) having an audience observing you performing a task.
* Study results are consistent: a simple, well-learned task, and presence improves our performance.
** If we have studied hard, know the material well, better do that exam in a room full of people.
* Studies have shown, that when other people (or other animals) are around, performing a _difficult task_ will decrease our performance.
* Arousal and the dominant response:
** The presence of others increases our physiological arousal (bodies become more energized).
** This way, it is easier to perform a dominant response (e.g. something we are good at), but harder to do something complex, or learn something new.

.Social Facilitation
****
The presence of others, improving performance on simple, worsen on complex tasks.
****

* Three theories on why other's presence causes arousal?
** 1) Others make us alert/vigilant
*** We need to be alert to the possibility that the other will do something that requires us to respond.
*** People are less predictable than let's say a lamp, so we are in a state of greater alertness.
** 2) Others make us more apprehensive about how we're being evaluated.
*** We are often concerned about how others are evaluating us.
*** We will feel embarrassed if we do poorly, and pleased if doing well.
*** This evaluation apprehension (=concern about being judged) can cause arousal.
** 3) Others distract us from the task at hand.
*** We are being put in a state of conflict because it's difficult to pay attention to two things at the same time; divided attention.

=== Social Loafing

* Or: When the presence of others relaxes us.
* Sometimes, being surrounded by others allows us to slack off (or "loaf").
* For example when our individual efforts cannot be distinguished from others (clapping after concert, play instrument in a band).
** Situation is opposite than social facilitation: We merge into a group, become less noticeable, we relax; less evaluation apprehension.
* Whether performance improves or worsens, depends on the task's complexity.
* Experiment with pulling on a rope (1880s, French agricultural engineer, Max Ringelmann).
** Each individual exerted less effort than when doing so alone (TEAM: Toll Ein Anderer Machts).

.Social Loafing
****
Presence of others, and performance cannot be evaluated, performance worsens on simple, improves on complex/important tasks.
****

* Not only complexity of the task, but also how important it is to us, has an impact on our performance.

=== Social Facilitation or Loafing

* Both are distinguished by the variables of: evaluation, arousal and task-complexity.
* If it can be evaluated: Social facilitation (alertness, evaluation apprehension, distraction-conflict; arousal).
** If simple task: enhanced, if complex task: impaired.
* If it cannot be evaluated: Social loafing (no evaluation apprehension; relaxation).
** If simple task: impaired, if complex task: enhanced (vice versa than facilitation).

=== Gender and Culture

* Men tend to slack more than women.
* Women tend to be higher than men in _relational interdependence_: focus on/care about personal relationships with others.
* Loafing is stronger in Western cultures than Asian ones (interdependent view of the self).
** Might be due to different self-definitions prevalent in these cultures.
* With similar others, we more easily develop bonds and a sense of accountability.
** With dissimilar others, we expect less cooperation.

=== Conclusion

* To predict presence of others will help or not, know A) individual efforts evaluable and B) is the task simple or complex.
** Implications on how groups should be organized.
** E.g. working as a manager, give reward for simple problem to improve performance.

=== Deindividuation

.Deindividuation
****
Loosening of normal constraints on behavior, when people can't be identified (in a crowd).
****

* "Getting lost in the crowd", thus feeling anonymous, can lead us to behave in ways we would never to by ourselves.
* As a result something we sometimes refer to as "mob mentality".
** Think of times of war, where people loot, and rape; or hysterical fans at rock concerts trampling each other to death.
** Or white people (often cloaked in anonymity of hooded robes) lynching black people.
** Warriors who hid their identities before a battle (masks, face/body paint) are significantly more likely to kill, torture, or mutilate captive prisoners.

==== Less accountable

* Why does it lead us to more impulsive, and often violent, acts?
* Because of the reduced chances to be singled out/blamed for that act.

==== More obedient to norms

* Sometimes group norms conflict with norms of other groups or even society at large.
** When deindividuated, we are more likely to act according to this group's norms than societal norms.
** It increases adherence to the local group's norms.
* Imagine a rowdy part, everyone dances wildly to loud music.
** If it's dark, and you are dressed similarly than others, you will likely join the group and let loose dancing.
** You would do so less if the light was bright and no one was dancing.
* The specific group norm determines whether deindividuation leads to positive or negative behaviors.

==== Online

* Deindividuation is even stronger with less physical forms of interaction.
** We feel less inhibited and more anonymous.
* The internet "troll" is a modern example of deindividuation.
** That's why so many forums deteriorate, by obscene comments and provocations.
* A solution could be to require people to identify themselves/the information.
** People would be more civil, and free of profanities.
* Yet, online anonymous communication has also some advantages of course.
** Free and open discussion of difficult topics is possible; at the costs of common civility.
* If people were told that their parents might read their posts, it was a very effective tool to emphasize other influential norms (family).
** It also reminds people of their own, unique personal identity.

== Group Decisions

* Is making decisions better as individuals or groups, and what's the impact of having a leader in groups?
* We usually would assume that making decisions in groups are better than those as individuals.
** Reasoning: An individual is subject to all sorts of whims and biases.
** Several people can exchange ideas, catch each other's errors.
** "Hm, that's a really good point, I never would have thought of that."
** They freely contribute independent opinions from different viewpoints, using their unique areas of expertise.
* Yet, several factors can cause groups to make worse decisions than individuals would.

=== Process Loss

.Process Loss
****
Group interaction that inhibits good problem-solving.
****

* Most expert/talented members can convince others.
* You may know how it feels like, trying to convince a group of your idea, be faced with opposition/disbelief, and watch how they make the wrong decision.
* Groups don't try hard enough to find out who the most competent members are.
** Instead, they rely on someone who really doesn't know what they are talking about (and maybe simply is charming/popular/sociable).
* Also, communication problems arise: failure to listen, or allowing one person to dominate the discussion.

==== Failure to share unique information

* There is information we all know ("shared information") and bits only you know ("unique information").
* Funny thing about groups: They tend to focus on what they already collectively know.
** Unique information is usually shared later in the discussion; if it lasts long enough to go beyond the shared information.
* Solutions:
** Don't tell at the beginning what each member's personal preference is, otherwise they focus less on unique information.
** Create break-out groups, assigning each sub-group a specific area of expertise; responsible for certain types of information.
* In groups, learn who is responsible for what kinds of information (specialized individual), and take time to discuss unshared data.

.Transactive Memory
****
Combined group memory which is more efficient than individual's memory.
****

==== Groupthink: Many heads, one mind

.Groupthink
****
Group considers cohesiveness/solidarity more important than considering facts in a realistic manner.
****

* Group cohesiveness can get in the way of clear thinking and good decisions.
* Especially under certain preconditions: Group is highly cohesive, isolated from contrary opinions, and ruled by a directive leader.
* Groupthink is characterized by tight-knit, homogenous groups following the lead of a confident individual ("it was rarely questioned").
* Symptoms: group feels invulnerable and can do no wrong.
** People exercise self-censorship (say yes, think no), failing to voice contrary views (fear of dampening morale or being criticized).
** If a contrary viewpoint is voiced, the group is quick to criticize, pressuring person to conform to majority view.
** Creating an illusion of unanimity, looks like everyone agrees, under the surface/privately do not.
* Groupthink leads to an inferior decision-making process.
** They don't consider full range of alternatives, develop contingency plans, or adequately consider the risks of their choice.
* How to make it less likely?
** Remain impartial. A leader should not take a directive role
** Seek outside opinions. Invite opinions from non-members (less concerned with cohesiveness).
** Create subgroups. First meet separately, then meet together.
** Seek anonymous opinions. Write down secretly on paper, uncensored by fear.

The process:

. Antecedents (considering facts in realistic manner)
** highly cohesive: valued/attractive group, people want to be members
** isolation: not hearing alternative viewpoints
** directive leader: he controls the discussion, making own wishes
** high stress: members perceive threats to the group
** poor procedures: no standard methods to view alternative viewpoints
. Symptoms (in believes in behavior)
** illusion of invulnerability: feeling invincible, can't be wrong
** moral correctness believe: "god is on our side"
** stereotyped views of out-group: opposing sides are viewed simplistic
** self-censorship: not to "rock the boat"
** pressure on dissenters to conform to the majority
** illusion of unanimity: everyone seems to agree; not calling on people known to disagree
** mindguards: protecting leader form contrary viewpoints
. Consequences (defective decision making)
** incomplete survey of alternatives
** failure examining risks of choice: focus on good things
** poor information search: selective information gathering
** failure developing contingency plan: not plan B

=== Polarization

* "Risky shift": Groups make riskier decisions than individuals.
** Individual members already lean towards a risky decision, the group discussion will exaggerate that tendency.
** Also, when members are initially more conservative, the group will tend to be even more conservative than the individuals.

.Group Polarization
****
Decisions are more extreme, than initial member's inclinations.
****

* Two reasons:
** 1) *Persuasive arguments*: We are exposed to arguments we haven't thought of before.
** 2) *Social comparison*: We first check how everyone else feels, the group value; effort fo fit in and be liked.
*** We adapt to the group's opinion, but even a bit more extreme; present in positive light, being a "good" group member.
* Politics in social media are very much polarized; getting ideologically further apart.
* Individuals tend to underestimate the polarization effect; or are simply often unaware of it.

=== Leadership

.Great Person Theory
****
Certain key personality traits make a person a good leader (regardless of the situation).
****

==== Personality

* For example: intelligent, extraverted, charismatic, open to new experiences, confident, assertive.
* When looking at US presidents, those who became effective leaders were: tall, from small families, and published books.

==== Styles

.Transactional Leaders
****
Set clear, short-term goals and reward people.
****

.Transformational Leaders
****
Inspire people to focus on common, long-term goals.
****

* Transactional leaders do a good job making things run smoothly.
* Transformational leaders think out of the box; big-picture goals.

==== Right Situation

* In social psychology, we don't look only on personality, but also the situation the person is in.
* Consider Steve Jobs:
** When he was 21 and founded Apple Computer, he was  not a typical corporate leader.
** He went to India to experiment with LSD, living on a communal fruit farm.
** Only then he started a new industry and a billion-dollar company.
** But his unorthodox style forced him 1985 out due to losses of the company.
*** He co-founded Pixar in 1986, sold it to Disney 2006 for 8 billion.
** 1990 Apple struggled, needing a new operating system, and hired Steve Jobs to do so.
*** His ability to think creatively inspired his workforce to take risks and brought a new direction.
* A comprehensive theory of leadership considers: leader, followers, and the situation.
** Best known theory is the contingency theory of leadership.

.Contingency Theory of Leadership
****
Effectiveness depends on 1) how task-/relationship-oriented and 2) amount of control over the group.
****

* Two kinds of leaders:

.Task-Oriented Leaders
****
About getting the job done.
****

.Relationship-Oriented Leaders
****
About worker's feelings/relationships.
****

* Task-oriented leaders do well in _high-control work situations_; a powerful leader and work needs to be done in a structured and well-defined way.
** Also doing well in _low-control work situations_, when not perceived as powerful, and less clearly defined work.
** E.g. supervisor of a newly formed group of volunteers.
* Relationship-oriented leaders are most effective in _moderate-control work situations_.
** Wheels are turning smoothly, while job gets also done.

==== Gender

* Paradox of female leaders:
** If good leaders (agentic/male-tyipcal traits (assertive, controlling, dominant, independent), forceful) perceived negatively (as women "should" act).
** If good women, conform to society's expectation (warm, helpful, communal, affectionate), perceived low leadership potential.
* Female CEOs are also very rare: 15% US, 5% Taiwan, 4% Japan; yet higher in Norway 47%, Sweden 34%, and France 34%.
* Women are thought to be better at managing crises, especially interpersonal conflicts.
** Seems good, but has a downside, as they are more likely be put in precarious/high-risk positions, difficult to succeed.
** Even if women broke through the "glass ceiling" into top leadership positions: still being put in crisis/risk of failure is high.

.Glass Cliff
****
Women put it high-risk positions because of their positive prejudgements.
****

* Good news: Prejudice against female leaders is lessening over time:
** 1950: 66% prefer male, 5% female (25% don't care)
** 2010: 32% prefer male, 22% female (46% don't care)
* Women are more accepted to act in a stereotypically "male" way.
** Growing recognition: Effective leaders must be communal as well as agentic.

==== Culture

* Different cultures value different traits in leaders -not surprising.
** Autonomous leadership (independent of superior, working alone): more valued in Europe than Latin America.
** Universal agreement though: Charisma, and being team oriented.
* Getting more and more attention (and importance) due to global economy, more diverse, different cultures more frequent contact.

== Conflict and Cooperation

* If we have incompatible goals, we have a conflict.
** Sigmund Freud argued, a conflict is an inevitable by-product of individuals often clash with goals/needs with others.
* Conflicts often erupt into open hostilities.
** High divorce rate. Violence. Warfare between nations.

=== Social Dilemmas

* What is good for one, is not often good for everyone (cause of conflicts).
** Think of restaurants were you are free to pay as much as you want: If everyone stays stingy, the restaurant will go bankrupt.

.Social Dilemma
****
In a conflict, the most beneficial option for one (if chosen by majority), will damage everyone.
****

* Prisoner's dilemma: Two (literal) partners in crime captured by police, held separately.
** Betray your partner and receive a lighter sentence.
** Both keep quiet (stay loyal), prison only short time (not enough evidence).
** Both betray, longer in prison.
** One betrays, he goes free and the other gets maximum prison time.
** Similar experiment with winning money... Also: "The Public Goods Game"
* To find a solution desirable for both, people must trust each other.
** (In game theory, they figured through a bunch of simulations that tit-for-tat is the best working algorithm.)
** Lack of trust leads to an escalating series of competitive moves; thus, in the end no one wins.
* Like in a weapons race of countries; feel cannot afford to disarm out of fear other will take advantage.
** Result: stockpile weapons, neither gaining superiority, spending money better spent to solve domestic problems.

==== Increasing Cooperation

* Such conflicts are common and not inevitable.
** Question is, under which circumstances are people more willing to cooperate?
* Turned out, if one expects to have a future with the other person (friend, partner).
* Subtly changing the norms can have large effects.
** E.g. changing the name from "Wall Street Game" to "Community Game" (cooperatively play from 33% to 71%).

.Tit-for-Tat Strategy
****
Encouraging cooperation by first cooperate, then always respond what the other did before.
****

* This strategy communicates a willingness towards cooperation, and an unwillingness being exploited.
** On international level, meaning not only matching military buildup but also any conciliatory gesture.
* What also works is if we make individuals, instead of groups, resolve a conflict.
** As discussed before in link:../ch8-conformity/index.html[chapter 8] about conformity, people deindividuate in groups, creating more extreme/polarized attitudes.

=== Threats

* When in a conflict, we tend to use threats to make the other comply to our demands ("Speak softly and carry a big stick", Teddy Roosevelt).
** Parents and teachers use it to make children behave, but also on an international scale.
* Yet, studies have shown that threats are not an effective means of reducing conflict: The trucking game (by Deutsch and Krauss.
** Both had to make money by taking the shortest route, but that was a one-land road.
** Under first circumstance, they started to cooperate, taking turns and waiting for the other.
** Under the second, one (or both) had a gate to block the other (threat), which they heavily used.
** If both will lose (stalemate), we would expect to cooperate, but no: They lost even _more_ money in the bilateral threat condition, harming each other.

[#img-trucking]
.Map of the trucking game illustrating cooperative/competitive behaviour.
image::images/trucking_game.jpg[Trucking Game,400,100]

==== Effects of Communication

* That game mentioned before doesn't reflect real life properly, as both sides were not allowed to communicate.
** Alas, requiring people to communicate did not raise profits dramatically, as it didn't foster trust.
** In fact, they used the opportunity to threaten each other.
* In another version, the researches instructed the participants to use communication to work out a solution fair for both parties.
** This time, verbal communication fostered trust and increased profits for both.

=== Negotiation and Bargaining

.Negotiation
****
Communication of parties in conflict, using offers/counteroffers until agreed to a solution.
****

* In everyday life we have a wide array of options, esp. buying/selling.
** Try to arrive at a satisfactory settlement by talking, bargaining, and negotiating.
** Question is: How successful are we at negotiating mutually beneficial solutions?
* Limiting assumption: Only one party can come out ahead.
** We don't realize that a solution favorable to both parties is available.

.Integrative Solution
****
A compromise, solution to a conflict, where parties make trade-offs, each conceding/yielding unimportant issues for them, but important to the other.
****

* The more for us is at stake, the more biased our perception of the other.
** We will tend to distrust proposals by the other, and overlook common interests.
** That's why it's always good to have a neutral mediator: They are able to recognize mutually agreeable solutions.
* Style of communication is also critical developing trust.
** More easily established in face-to-face negotiations (than any electronic communication).
** Modern techniques have many advantages, but disadvantage is that it's harder to get to know people and learn to trust them.
* Bottom line:
** Try to gain the other person's trust first.
** Take the other person's perspective.
** Communicate your own interests in an open manner.
** Know that integrative solutions are often available.
** Remember both parties might construe the situation differently.

== Summary

* What are groups, why do we join them.
** A group consists of 2+ interdependent people who interact.
** We join for the (innate) need to belong.
*** Allow to accomplish difficult objectives.
*** Serve as a source of information (about the social world).
*** Important to our social identity. Make use feel distinctive from members of other groups.
*** For that, we are sensitive of rejection from groups.
** Composition and function of groups:
*** Homogeneous members, with social norms to obey.
*** Well-defined social roles, shared expectations (how to behave); extreme: lose personal identity.
*** Group cohesiveness: binding members together, promote liking.
*** Diverse composition leading to negative morale but positive performance.
* How individuals perform differently when others are around.
** Social Facilitation: If efforts can be evaluated, simple task improve, complex tasks impaired.
** Social Loafing: If efforts cannot be evaluated, relaxation, thus performance impaired on simple/unimportant, but improved on complex tasks.
** Gender and Culture: Social loafing more prevalent among men (than women) and more in Western (than Asian) cultures.
** Deindividuation: Loosening of normal constraints on behavior when we are in crowds.
* Decision-making differences between individuals vs groups; impact of leadership in group outcomes.
** Group decision: Are more heads leading to a better result? Not necessarily!
** Process loss: When group interactions inhibit good problem-solving
*** If good at pooling independent ideas, and listening to the expert members, they do better.
*** Groups often focus on shared info, fail to share unique info.
*** Groupthink: Tightly knit, cohesive groups, where cohesiveness/solidarity more important than considering the facts.
** Group polarization: Going to extremes.
*** Causing individuals to become more extreme than initial were.
** Leadership:
*** Little support for the ``great person theory''; leadership matter of right personality traits.
*** Styles: transactional, or transformational.
*** Women often face the ``glass cliff'', put in crisis with high risk of failure.
*** Double bind for women: conform being warm, yet incompetent. Non-conform and be competent (forceful), not be a real women.
* Factors whether group conflict escalates/resolves.
** Especially when people have incompatible goals.
** Social Dilemmas:
*** Most beneficial action for individual, if chosen by majority, harmful for everyone.
*** See for example also the prisoner's dilemma.
*** Creating trust is crucial!
** Threatening escalates, rather resolves; even more so if both parties have equal threat capacity.
** When negotiating/bargaining, look for an integrative solution, consider dropping unimportant to you but important to the other.

= Self-test Methodology

[#test1]
== 1. Empirical Science

. Why does it feel like we could have *predicted* scientific results ourselves easily?
.. Those studies are famous, we *heard about* them.
.. We have such an *advanced understanding* of humans.
.. Because of the *hindsight bias*, exaggerate how easily we could have predicted it.
.. We use the *collective unconscious memory*.
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#
. What's true about psychological *findings*?
.. Seem obvious, after we learn about them, because of the *hindsight bias*.
.. *Most people* can easily predict results in advance.
.. *Wise people* can easily predict them in advance.
.. People living in the *same culture* can predict them.
** [hiddenAnswer]#a.#
. Why do new ideas *base on previous* theories/research?
.. Previous experts *know it best*.
.. Previous theories *explain it better*.
.. Older theories/research can *always be refined*/improved.
.. Newer psychologists are *unoriginal*.
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#

[#test2]
== 2. Research Design

. What study is best for *ethnography* (=study a culture/group from the inside)?
.. What makes Greenpeace people commit to their ideals?
.. Do violent games make more violent?
.. Do people litter more, when there is already litter?
.. Check Twitter to see people's mood fluctuation.
** [hiddenAnswer]#a. (in case the study is done from within)#
. Why is inter-judge reliability important observational studies?
.. To make them more empirical.
.. To make them more subjective.
.. To make them less subjective (not distorted by one person).
.. To resolve disputes between researchers.
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#
. Which are the three main methods being used?
.. observational, ethnographical, experimental
.. correlational, observational, archival analysis
.. correlational, observational, surveys
.. correlational, observational, experimental
** [hiddenAnswer]#d.#
. Limits of observational method?
.. Some behavior happens only rarely/privately.
.. Participants refuse to be observed.
.. Can only being done in lab.
.. Only describe, but not predict behavior.
** [hiddenAnswer]#a.#
. Negative correlation between education and denial of climate change. What's the conclusion?
.. Those people know more scientists.
.. Education predicts believe in climate change.
.. Less educated people don't know how to interpret information.
.. Less money, less education ones are less informed.
** [hiddenAnswer]#b. (everything else would be too far fetched; assumptions)#
. A study checks likelihood to donate after random sample receiving (or not) a small gift. What is true about this study?
.. It uses a correlational method.
.. Independent variable is got the gift, dependent is donation.
.. Independent variables is donation, dependent got the gift.
.. Low internal validity: people receiving the gift may vary in different ways.
** [hiddenAnswer]#a. and b.#
. How to increase external validity (=generalizability)?
.. Low psychological realism.
.. Do it in lab instead field.
.. Replicate with different population/setting.
.. Have minimum two dependent variables.
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#
. Experiments are done in the lab because:
.. Increase internal validity.
.. Increase external validity.
.. Conduct a meta-analysis.
.. Decrease psychological realism.
** [hiddenAnswer]#a.#

[#test3]
== 3. New Frontiers

. Goal of cross-cultural research?
.. Which things are cultural or universal.
.. Answer things like: Are video games destroying cultures?
.. Rank/compare cultures.
.. Are all things dictated by culture?
** [hiddenAnswer]#a.#
. Goal of social neuroscience?
.. Legitimize social psychology as a science (through EEGs and fMRIs).
.. Settle debate whether things happen by brain or culture.
.. Explore brain activity correlates social information processing; evaluating parts involved while think about social things.
.. Check processes happen even without others being present; evaluating parts involved while think about social things.
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#

[#test4]
== 4. Ethical Issues

. About informed consent.
.. Can be done before or after.
.. Doesn't need to explain the experiment's nature.
.. Tell what experiences they agree on.
.. Not necessary unless there is a deception.
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#
. What is most important in experiments?
.. As real as possible.
.. As controlled as possible (to increase validity).
.. Maintain health/welfare of participants.
.. Find answers useful for society (aggression, prejudice).
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#
. About debriefing (post-experimental interview).
.. If discomfort, counteract it.
.. Not necessary if informed consent given.
.. Tell goals/purpose and deceptions.
.. All of the above.
** [hiddenAnswer]#a. and c.#

[#test5]
== 5. Test Yourself

. How to devise new study ideas?
.. Use earlier theories.
.. Use earlier research and refine it.
.. Based on own life experience or what's in the news.
.. ALl of the above.
** [hiddenAnswer]#b.#
. Positive correlation (0.8) between income and education. What's the conclusion?
.. After college, you'll earn 40k per year.
.. Education has a positive effect on income.
.. Income is the only predictor of education.
.. The more education, the higher the income tends to be.
** [hiddenAnswer]#d.#
. How to improve external validity?
.. Use observational method.
.. Use correlational method.
.. Use real-life setting.
.. Use a good cover story.
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#
. About cross-cultural research.
.. To increase internal validity.
.. At least three times replicated to be valid.
.. Social psychology started by Westerners, which were not concerned about generalizability.
.. Goal to see whether universal or culture-bound results.
** [hiddenAnswer]#d.#
. What's _not true_ about field experiments?
.. Use real-life setting.
.. Same design as lab experiments.
.. Use an independent, but not a dependent variable.
.. High in external validity.
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#
. Experiment split participants randomly in half. Play violent or neutral game. Afterwards "accidental" bump into them. React aggressive or not.
.. High external validity.
.. Independent variable is reaction, dependent is which game.
.. Meets the "random assignment to condition" condition.
.. Dependent variable is reaction, independent is which game.
** [hiddenAnswer]#d.#
. Process/purpose of repeating same experiment to wider range of participants?
.. Random assignment to condition; to increase generalizability.
.. Meta-analysis; increase internal validity.
.. Replication; increase external validity.
.. Replication; increase internal validity.
** [hiddenAnswer]#a.#
. Basic dilemma of social psychology?
.. Hard to teach, most believe in personality.
.. Trade-off between internal and external validity.
.. Impossible to use random selection.
.. All behavior is influenced by culture.
** [hiddenAnswer]#b.#
. About new frontiers.
.. Interested in culture, but not evolution.
.. Interested in evolution, but not role of culture.
.. Use brain imaging to correlate brain activity with social information processing.
.. Cross-cultural research to show everything is universal.
** [hiddenAnswer]#c.#
. All except one is an ethical guideline. Which one?
.. An IRB consists of at least a scientist, a non-scientist and an unaffiliated person.
.. Informed consent, unless deception necessary and meets ethical guidelines.
.. When deception, then must be debriefed.
.. Must be a cover story for every study, because all studies involve some deception.

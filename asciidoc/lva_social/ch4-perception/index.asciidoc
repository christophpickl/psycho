= Social Perception

* We might ask ourselves a long list of social questions, like:
** Can I trust him?
** Should I get to know him better?
** Why is she the way she is?
** Why is she doing what she is doing?
* We constantly evaluate others, and try to figure out the reasons for their behavior.

.Social Perception
****
How we form impressions of others, and draw inferences about them.
****

* Remember that episode with Lacie Pound in "Black Mirror" where people would reach other?
** Well, a single-minded pursuit of popularity doesn't always lead to happiness
** This satire exaggerates our current obsession with social media likes and other forms of superficiality.
* We might not use overlays with ratings in an augmented reality, still...
** We use external characteristics to quickly evaluate people and make snap judgements.
** We use indicator like: Clothes, car brand, food (organic, processed, gluten-free).

[#img-blackmirror]

image::images/black_mirror_lacie.jpg[Black Mirror,400,100]

* We have this fundamental desire to understand people, to explain why others behave as they do.
** Found in our recreational lives: Movies, novels, we eavesdrop on conversations, watch people flirting, and reality TV shows.
** Simply because it fascinates us and enjoy, to think about behavior of others, to figure them out.
* Why do we analyze other people so much?
** Answer: It helps us to understand and predict our social universe.
* The difficulty is that the reasons are usually hidden from us (we can't read minds).
** Only thing available is observable behavior: how people act, what they say, facial expressions, gestures, tone of voice.
** We try to reach conclusions also by relying on subtle cues and quick impressions.

== Nonverbal Communication

.Nonverbal Communication
****
Communicating using no words but channels like: facial expressions, tone of voice, gestures, body position, movement, touch, and gaze.
****

* It can be intentionally or unintentionally.
* It serves multiple functions:
** Express our emotions/attitudes/personality (and perceive in others).
** E.g. expressing anger by lowering eyebrows, and thinning the lips.
** E.g. expressing being an extravert with broad gestures.
** Think about how difficult it is to convey your real message through text only communication (which is why we use emojis).
* Also very important in political debates and press conferences (not only what, but also "how" it is being said).
* Every cable news channel has these days their own "body language expert".
* In everyday life, nonverbal cues require orchestration of simultaneous information

[NOTE.tryit,caption=TRY IT]
====
*Nonverbal Vocal Cues*

* Not only what, but also how we say it matters.
** Conveying different meanings depending on how we say it.
* Say the sentence "_I don't know her_" out loudly, using the emotions: anger, sarcasm, fear, surprise, disgust, happiness.
** Play with pitch, speed, loudness, which words to stress.
* Next, try with a friend: Facing back (so only audio matters) and try to guess the emotion.
** If guessed wrong, discuss and try to identify specifics of a sound.
====

=== Facial Expressions of Emotions

[#img-facial_emotions]
.The six major emotions expressed facially.
image::images/facial-emotions.jpg[Facial Emotion,500,100]

* It is said to be the "crown jewel" of nonverbal communication.

==== Evolution

.Coding
****
*Encode* (express): Express/emit nonverbal behavior.

*Decode* (interpret): Interpret nonverbal behavior.
****

* Primary emotions are universal: All humans encode (=express) and decode (=interpret) emotions the same way.
** They are "species specific" and not "cultural specific".
* Facial expressions were vestiges of once-useful physiological reactions.
** E.g. the "fear face" enhances perception (more sensory input, seeing more), whereas disgust decreases it.
* Most famous link:../../people/ekman-paul.html[Paul Ekman] researched emotions.
** Confirmed link:../../people/darwin-charles.html[Charles Darwin] in his idea of universal facial expression of emotions.
** Studied natural tribes and modern civilizations on how they encode/decode emotions in facial expressions.
* Yet, this universality is true for only "the most part"; it's more complicated.
** Westerners have rigid boundaries between those emotions; Easterners show more overlap in the use of these categories.
** Cross-cultural differences when having to freely group faces.
** Also we are better at decoding facial expressions when that person is from the same ethnic group.
** The cultural variation in encoding/decoding is still an open research topic...
* What about other emotions?
** Such as: contempt, anxiety, shame, determination, envy, embarrassment? Ongoing research.
** E.g. pride seems to exists cross-culturally: smile, head back, expand chest, arms raised/on hips.
*** Even blind athletes use this "victory pose", although never have seen it.
** E.g. shame as well: slumped shoulders, sunken chest.
*** In individualistic cultures, shame is stigmatized, negative, and we rather hide to display it.

[#img-notimpressed]
."McKayla is not impressed"-facial expression
image::images/not_impressed.jpg[Not Impressed,400,100]

==== Difficult to decode

.Affect Blends
****
Facial expressions, two different parts register different emotions.
****

* Why is it difficult to decode facial expressions? Because people often display *affect blends*.
* E.g. someone told you that was both horrible and inappropriate.
** You'd be disgusted by the content, and angry at the person.
* Same expression can also have different meanings based on context/other cues (e.g. eye gaze).
** When angry (an approach-oriented emotion), then stare right at you.
** When afraid (a avoidance-oriented emotion), then avert gaze, look to the scary object, signaling.

=== Culture and channels

.Display Rules
****
Cultural rules which nonverbal communication is appropriate.
****

* Paul Ekman et al studied influence of culture to facial display of emotions for decades.
* Display rules are *culturally dependent*.
** E.g. In Japan, people cover up negative expressions with smiles/laughter, and show fewer expressions in general.
** E.g. In America, men are not allowed to express emotions like grief or crying.
* Rules about *eye contact*/gaze differ.
** E.g. In America, you are considered suspicious if you don't look them in the eye.
*** In other parts of the world, doing so is considered invasive/disrespectful.
* There are also rules about *personal space*.
** Deviations from "normal" spacing affect your impression of a person.
* Hand gestures ("emblems") also common to be used.
** Like the "OK" sign, showing the middle finger (üñïüèª "flipping the bird"), or "V" for victory.

.Emblems
****
Cultural nonverbal gestures which clear verbal translations.
****

* Nonverbal communication tell us attitudes/emotions/intentions.
* Much is fairly consistent across cultures (like major emotion expressions).
* But also much is interpreted differently (eye contact, personal distance, gestures).

=== Cultural Differences in Nonverbal Communication

* Many are cultural specific.
* Some have no meaning at all.
* Some are interpreted differently.

==== Eye contact and gaze

* In America, if you won't look into the eye, you are perceived as evasive, or even lying.
* In other parts, direct eye contact is disrespectful, especially with superiors.
* In Japan, there is less eye contact.
* In Arabic countries, there is lots of eye contact, which we would consider a piercing gaze.

==== Personal space and touching

* High-contact cultures: Middle Eastern, South America, southern Europe.
* Low-contact cultures: North America, northern Europe, Asia.
* It differs based on same-sex touching among friends.
** Korea and Egypt men and women hold hands, and link arms with same-sex friends.

==== Hand and head gestures

* OK sign üëåüèª
** In US it means "okay".
** In Japan it means "money".
** In France it means "zero".
** In Mexico it means "sex"..
** In Ethiopia it means "homosexuality".
** In Brazil (and other South American countries) it's the same as our middle finger gesture.
* Thumbs-up gesture üëçüèª
** In US (and most Europe) it means "okay".
** In France it means "excellent".
** In Japan it means "boyfriend".
** In Iran and Sardinia it is obscene.
* Hand-purse gesture ü§åüèª
** No clear meaning in US.
** In Italy it means "What are you trying to say?".
** In Spain it means "good".
** In Tunisia it means "slow down".
** In Malta it means "you may seem good, but you are really bad".

==== Other body movements

* Nodding in US "yes", shaking means "no".
* In Africa and India it's the other way round.
* In Korea, shaking means "I don't know".

== First Impressions

* They are quick but long-lasting. But how do they form and persist?
* The first thing we know about a person is what we see and hear.
** We shouldn't not "judge a book by its cover", yet we use the slightest cues to form an impression.
* For example: Tidy or messy room? Office desk? Amount of personal objects? Your car?
** If people have fewer personal objects on the office desk, they prefer a clear separation of private and professional life.
** Extraverted people tend to decorate public spaces more, more inviting to others, sparking a conversation for passersby.

[NOTE.tryit,caption=TRY IT]
====
*Online Impressions*

* On social media, we exaggerate the good, and downplay the bad.
* Degree of exaggeration depends on motivation.
** To maintain existing relationships = more accurate in self-depictions.
* Which specific media also has an impact.
** On Facebook, first real friends then online friends, thus difficult to mislead.
** On Tinder, way more inaccurate profile information.
* The more Facebook friends = the more extraverted.
* The more frequent profile picture changes = the more open to new experiences.
* Using social media less = higher on conscientiousness (meet deadlines, avoid procrastination).
* Difficult for us to make an impression online.
** Only small amount of data available.
** Distinguish between what someone is really like, and what they _want_ you to think they're like.
** Consider the broader context: Presenting to existing friends, or establish new social connections?
====

* Initial impressions (based on facial appearance) takes about 100 milliseconds!
** Snap judgement for example based on "baby face" (Di Caprio).
** Big eyes, small chin/nose, high forehead = naive/gullible, warm/friendly/honest, submissive.
* Yet, there is some evidence that these are actually accurate judgements (based on facial appearance).
** "Gaydar": Based on photographs we can judge their sexual orientation (above chance levels of accuracy).
** Unfamiliar, winning political candidates can be spotted based on pictures (powerfulness, warmth).
* Looks are a significant predictor of success!
** We use first impressions to judge abilities/personalities.
** Even an extreme brief snippet of behavior in social perception can lead to (somewhat accurate?) judgements.

.Thin-Slicing
****
Draw conclusions about personality/skills based on very small sample of behavior.
****

* Study: Showing 10sec video clip without audio of a teacher to students.
** Rate them on competence, confidence, activeness.
** Although they were fast, they was an significant correlation (with end-semester evaluations).
* On the other hand, it can not only yield meaningful information, but also perpetuate stereotypes.

=== Lingering Influence

* When we are unsure (insufficient information) about social world, we use schemas (=mental shortcuts) to fill in the gaps.
** By just a little information, we already can create a full impression of someone.
* But, those initial impressions will color the subsequent information we get, as the schema was already activated.

.Primacy Effect
****
What we learn first (traits) about someone, influences (colors) how we see the information we learn next.
****

* Although the content of two descriptions is the same, if the order is not, we will judge the person differently.
** link:../../people/asch-solomon.html[Solomon Asch] figured by studies that the order made a big difference.
** Why? Because first impressions are powerful. They create a filter (schema) through which subsequent traits are viewed.
** We bring those subsequent ones in line with our initial expectations.
* Also schemas tell us which traits appear grouped together in clusters.
** If we know little about someone, we use schemas to infer other traits as well.
** E.g. a capable, can-do person is also seen as powerful and dominant.
** E.g. we presume "what is beautiful is good"; simple physical beauty mean other wonderful qualities to us.

.Belief Perseverance
****
We stick to an initial judgement, even if counterfactual information should make us reconsider.
****

* So we stay with our initial conclusions, although new information shows we shouldn't.
** We do so, even if that conclusion turns out to be contradicted or revealed as erroneous.
** E.g. it is difficult for jurors to disregard evidence ruled inadmissible.
** E.g. scientists are slow to discount research which turned out to use fabricated data.
** E.g. voters stay influenced by misinformation even after it has been discredited.
* We do so, because we find inconsistent thoughts as unpleasant and uncomfortable (see chapter 6 on link:../ch6-justification/index.html[self-justification]).
* That's why the we have to start off on the right foot!
** E.g. the opening moment of your presentation must be most polished.
** E.g. your clothes, eye contact, body posture might decide over the outcome of a job interview.

[#img-shakehands]
.Even simple things like shaking hands can have a dramatic effect.
image::images/shaking_hands.jpg[Shaking Hands,400,100]

* Using first impressions to your advantage (impression management).
** We use handshakes to assess other people's personality.
** We pay attention to people's clothes and how much eye contact they make.
** Being in a high-power pose ("victory") makes us feel more powerful (do so before a speech/interview).
** On social networks and dating apps, we show only the best of us, sometimes at the expense of accuracy (too much impression management can seem disingenuous though).

== Causal Attribution

* Answering the "Why" question, and how we determine wy others do what they do.
* Someone says "It's great to see you!"
** Does she really mean it? Or simply acting polite?! Maybe outright lying!

.Attribution Theory
****
How we explain own/other's behavior.
****

=== Attribution Process

* link:../../people/heider-fritz.html[Fritz Heider] is father of attribution theory.
** His book defined the field of social perception; still present in current research.
** People are like amateur scientists; naive, commonsense psychology.
* Dichotomy of why behave in a certain way: internal or external.

.Internal Attribution
****
Behaving because of the person itself (disposition, attitude, character, personality).
****

.External Attribution
****
Behaving because of situation (most people would do so as well).
****

* E.g. Attributions are a strong predictor of relationship satisfaction in the long run.
** Satisfied spouses make internal attribution about other's positive behaviors, and external about negative ones; when in distress do the opposite.

=== Covariation Model

* The first step in social perception is whether to make *internal or external attributions*.
* In general, we *tend* to use *internal* attributions.
** E.g.: _A road rage is assumed to be because of bad temper. If knew that in a rush to hospital, we might come to a different (external) attribution._
* According to the covariation model, we examine multiple behaviors from different times/situations, to explain behavior.

.Covariation Model
****
Theory about *attribution formation* (causes of a behavior), based on pattern between when behavior occurred and presence/absence of *causal factors*.
****

* We use data about a person's behavior that *changes* ("covaries") across *time/place*.
** Discovering covariations, we make conclusions about the behavior's cause.
* Three types of covariation information, when forming an attribution:
[arabic]
.. *Consensus* (other people too?)
.. *Distinctiveness* (other situations too?)
.. *Consistency* (all the time?)

.Consensus Information
****
Others behave the same way to the same stimulus.
****

* How other behave toward the same stimulus.
* Is there consensus to how various people respond to a stimulus?
** If so, maybe it's about the stimulus itself.
** If not, it's more about the person than the stimulus.

.Distinctiveness Information
****
One behaves the same way to different stimulus.
****

* How a specific person responds to other stimuli.
** If act the same, it's more about the person.
** If act differently for all other stimuli, it might be about the stimuli (and/or the person's relation to it).

.Consistency Information
****
One behaves to a particular stimulus the same across time/circumstances.
****

* The frequency the behavior appears between the same person and the same stimulus, across time and circumstances.
** Is the behavior happening all the time, and no matter other factors are changing?

==== Combinations

* When consistency is low: difficult to make attribution (could be a fluke).
* Consistency is high: attribution can be made by looking at the other two types of information.
** Plus consensus and distinctiveness are low: internal attribution.
** Plus consensus and distinctiveness are high (all three high): external attribution.

=== Example

Your boss keeps yelling at Hannah. Is it about him (internal) or something external (Hanna's work ethic, pressure from investors, ...). The covariation model can help to determine the answer using three variables.

[cols="1|1|1|1|1"]
|===
|Consensus | Distinctiveness | Consistency | Attribution | Example

| Low - only the boss yells at her | Low - he yells at everyone | High - he always yells at her | = Internal | It's about your boss' personality.
| High - everyone yells at her | High - he yells only at her | High - he always yells at her | = External | It's about her attitude.
| Low/High | Low/High | Low | No Attribution | Difficult to make an attribution.
|===

==== Criticism

* This model assumes we are rational, using logic to observe clues, to logically infer causal attributions.
* But we don't use consensus information that much (more consistency/distinctiveness).
* And we don't have always all the relevant information available.
** This leads us to *guesses* about the *missing data*.
* The model portrays us as master detectives, deducing the causes of behavior in a systematical and logical way (Sherlock Holmes like).
** However, we are not always logical/rational when forming judgements.
** We *distort information*, to satisfy our need for high *self-esteem*.
** Using *mental shortcuts* can lead to inaccurate judgements.
* Thus, our attributions are sometimes plain wrong.

=== Fundamental Attribution Error

* _People as personality psychologists_.
** The fundamental theory/schema we use to explain other's behavior: because of what they are (not the situation they are in).
** Like personality psychologists: Behavior stems from internal dispositions and traits.
* Yet, we overestimate the internal, and underestimate the situation factors => link:../../phenomena/fundamental_attribution_error.html[fundamental attribution error].

.Fundamental Attribution Error
****
We overestimate the internal, and underestimate the situational factors, when explaining other's behavior.
****

* We overlook the role of the situation, and jump to conclusions about internal explanations.
** Yet, others sometimes indeed do what they do because of the kind of people they are.
** However, situations can strongly affect behavior, and those can be extremely powerful.

==== Perceptual Salience

* When we try to explain person's behavior, we focus on the person, not the situation.
** The situational causes are invisible to us. (we don't know what happened to him earlier that day)
** Even if we would know, we don't know how those were interpreted.
** If we don't know the meaning of the situation to him, we can't accurately judge its effects on his behavior.
* So the situation is mostly unknown, and the individual is "perceptually prominent" to us (eyes and ears notice people).
** People, not situation, have *perceptual salience* for us.
** Pay attention to them, think about them, and assume they alone cause their behavior.

"Salience is that property by which some thing stands out. Salient events are an attentional mechanism by which organisms learn and survive; those organisms can focus their limited perceptual and cognitive resources on the pertinent subset of the sensory data available to them. Saliency typically arises from contrasts between items and their neighborhood."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salience_(neuroscience)
----

.Perpetual Salience
****
Seeming importance of information that is the focus of people's attention.
****

* Imagine the following experiment:
** Two talkers are having a conversation (both are actors), and none is more dominant in it, they are equals.
** Now multiple observers (participants) with a different view on this conversations pay attention to either one, or both talkers.
** At the end, the observers had to rate which talker had a bigger role (or both equal) in the conversation.
** As perceptual salience predicted: The person they could see better, they thought had more impact.
* Perceptual salience triggers the fundamental attribution error.

[#img-salience]
.Experiment showing the effect of perceptual salience. The result: people rated the actor they could see having a larger role in the conversation.
image::images/salience.png[Perceptual Salience,400,100]

* This insight has led to Australia coming up with a law, that interrogations have to be recorded from the side, capturing both the suspect and the detective.

==== Two-Step Attribution Process

* First we make an automatic (quick, spontaneous) *internal* attribution, when explaining a person's behavior.
** After that, we sometimes *adjust* this attribution, considering the situation.
** We often don't make that adjustment: we are distracted/preoccupied, and it's conscious/effortful.

.Two-Step Attribution Process
****
First automatic internal, then possibly second external attribution.
****

[#img-twostepattribution]
.The two-step process of attribution comic
image::images/twostepattribution.jpg[Two step attribution,800,100]

* The second step *requires* us to:
** consciously *slow down* and think carefully (before judging).
** being cognitively *alert and motivated*.
** being *suspicious*.

=== Self-Serving Attributions

* Imagine you get a positive result in your exam; you naturally take personal credit for this success.
** What if you would get a negative result back? External events, like an unfair test, the teacher doesn't like you, of course.
* When our self-esteem is threatened, we make self-serving attributions.

.Self-Serving Attributions
****
One's success because of internal, and failures due to external factors.
****

* This is particularly interesting in sports.
** Less experienced athletes, and athletes in solo sports, make it more often.
* Why do we do that? To maintain our self-esteem; even if it means distorting reality by changing thoughts/beliefs.
** Especially when we fail, and we feel we can't improve at it. Yet, if we feel we can improve, more likely internal attribute, and work on improving.
** Also when wanting to present ourselves to others. Put a "good face" on failure and manage impressions.
*** Telling others that our poor performance was due to external causes.
** Depending on which information is available to us, we might infer internal or external attributions.

.Belief in a Just World
****
Bad things to bad people, good things to good people.
****

* We alter our attributions also when tragic events happen (random attacks, terminal diseases, fatal accidents).
** Even when they happen to total strangers, because this remind us, those can also happen to us.
** We desperately try to deny this fact, by believing bad things only happen to bad people (or who made mistakes or poor decisions).
** Bad things won't happen to us, because we won't be that careless -so the belief.
* The assumption of: "People get what they deserve, and deserve what they get".
* One way to keep anxiety-provoking thoughts at bay about one's own safety:
** Don't acknowledge the randomness of a certain event, to make oneself feel better/safer.
** E.g. When someone is being raped, assuming that she did something to trigger the attack.
*** Did she act suggestively, or even invited the perpetrator? Did she wear something unusual sexy? (examples of *defensive attribution process*)
*** Those beliefs make us feel better, by placing some of the blame on the victim.

=== Bias Blind Spot

* Participants were asked how susceptible they thought they were and also for an average person.
** Of course, they rated the average way higher, which ironically itself is a self-serving belief in its own.

.Bias Blind Spot
****
Others are more susceptible to attributional biases than us.
****

* What to do about it?
** Reflect more carefully on our judgement process.
** Check more thoroughly our conclusions.
** Remind ourselves that a bias blind spot may be lurking.

*Examples of self-serving bias:*

1. Receiving a bad grade: In order to protect our ego from negative feedback, we blame external factors for our poor grade.
2. Victim blaming: When natural disaster strikes, we remain immune from such tragedy by believing it's God's punishment for immoral behavior.
3. Robbed blaming: Wouldn't happen to you as you take better precautions of cause, which make us feel safer in an often unpredictable world.
4. Rape blaming: Claiming the victim did something (dressed) to provoke, to avoid to have to acknowledge that anyone could become a victim of sexual violence.
5. Karma belief: As in the saying "what goes around comes around", which might be reassuring, but prevents us from a fuller, more reasoned consideration of events.

== Culture

* Western cultures emphasize individual autonomy.
** We have to be independent and self-contained. Behavior reflects internal traits/motives/values.
** Based on Judeo-Christian belief in the individual soul; and English legal tradition of individual rights.
* Eastern cultures stress group autonomy on the other hand.
** Based on Confucian tradition ("community man", "social being"), as well as Daoism and Buddhism (unity of all).

=== Holistic vs Analytic Thinking

* Cultural differences predict different ways of what information we notice/pay attention to.
* Western, individualistic, thus *analytical thinking style*.
** Focusing on properties of object (or people).
* Easter, collectivistic, thus *holistic thinking style*.
** Focusing on context/situation; the whole picture; the object (or person) and the surrounding context; relations.
* Of course big variability exists within a culture, still there are generalized differences which predict how we perceive others.
* E.g. when seeing another person's face, and ask ourselves what she is feeling...
** Western: analytic, use face alone to make a decision.
** Eastern: holistic, scan faces of the others in the group.

==== Social Neuroscience Evidence

* Thinking styles predict how the brain responds to social stimuli.
* Experiment, make judgements about length of lines inside boxes, while in an fMRI.
** Some were told ignore the box (the context), some told to pay attention to it (attend the context).
** More brain activity (effort) was visible, when they had to follow the instruction which was opposite their cultural thinking style.
** To be specific, the higher-order cortical regions (frontal/parietal areas).
** Meaning exert more attention (work harder cognitively) to perceive objects in an atypical way.

=== Fundamental Attribution Error and Culture

* Not surprising, individualistic cultures prefer dispositional attributions, and collectivistic situational.
* Environmental forces (=cultural experiences) play a major role in social perception.
* Children (from US and India) did not show differences explaining a friend's behavior.
** Differences are not inborn, but we have some flexibility of thinking style, that's molded over time by cultural influences.
* Fun experiment, where people were first primed with US / Asian images, and then shown a picture to explain behavior.
** 30% of the control group (no priming) made situational attributions.
** 50% made situational attributions ("_The fish is being chased by the other fish._"), when primed with Asian images.
** 15% made dispositional attributions ("_The fish is leading the other fish._"), when primed with US images.
* Westerners think like personality psychologists, Easterners like social psychologists. But of course all a matter of degree\...

=== Other Attributional Biases and Culture

* The self-serving bias is the strongest in Western countries.
* In traditional Asian cultures, values of modesty and harmony with others.
** E.g. Chinese students attribute their success to others, or the high quality of their school.
** Taking less credit, reflecting the values of their culture.
* "Cultural products" (advertising, song lyrics, TV shows, art) reflect our culture's values.
* E.g. sports competitors show cross-cultural variability in attributional tendencies.
** American gold medalists explain their performance in terms of their unique abilities and talents.
** Japanese media would emphasize the role of the coaches, teammates, and family.
** Americans: "I think I just stayed focused... What I could do... I could beat her... this is my night."
** Japanese: "Best coach ... best manager... people who support me ... together and became a gold medal."
* Regarding self-serving bias:
** Americans focus in general more on positive than negative aspects.
** Yet they tend more toward that bias; explain failure on the outside, and success on the inside.
** Asian cultures show more self-critical attributions.
*** More important to keep the "social glue", holding the group together.
*** In response to self-criticism, others offer sympathy/compassion, strengthening the interdependence of the group.
* The "belief in a just world" is a defensive attribution (just-world attribution).
** Viewing life as saf/orderly/predictable.
** There is a cultural component in that: Where there are more extremes of wealth/poverty, this attribution is more common.
** Used to explain/justify justice, think about karma: 1.5 billion people (Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism) believe in it.
*** Good moral behavior shall we rewarded, and bad punished.
*** This topic is highly understudied.

** Facial expressions and emotions
*** Six major, universal emotions; en/decoded similarly across cultures; evolutionary significance
*** Affect blends: one part face registers one, another part a different emotion
*** Mirror neurons enable empathy
** Culture and Channels
*** E.g.: Eye gaze, touch, personal space, gesture, tone of voice
*** Display rules: particular to each culture; which emotional expressions are accepted
*** Emblems: gestures with well-defined meanings; culturally determined
* First impressions
** Quick, but long-lasting: facial structure, possessions, attire; within milliseconds
*** Thin-slicing: snap judgements, deliver meaningful information
*** Lingering influence
**** Primacy effect: first traits we perceive, influence subsequent learned information
**** Belief perseverance: Clinging to conclusions
* Why we do what we do - Causal attribution: The "why"; attribution theory: understand/predict social world
** Nature of it: internal (dispositional), external (situational)
** Covariation model: across time/place/actors/targets; consensus/distinctiveness/consistency information
** Fundamental Attribution Error: mental shortcuts (schemas, theories)
*** Believe behavior corresponds to dispositions
*** Behavior has greater perceptual salience
*** Two-step attribution process: initial is automatic with tendency dispositional; altered by situational in a second step
** Self-serving attribution: attributions influenced by personal needs
*** Success internal, failure external
*** Belief in a just world: avoid thoughts about our own mortality
*** Bias blind spot: others more susceptible to attributional biases
* Culture influences social perception/attribution
** Social perception: differences cross-culturally
** Western = individualistic = analytic thinking; properties of object
** Eastern = collectivistic = holistic thinking; context, whole picture relations

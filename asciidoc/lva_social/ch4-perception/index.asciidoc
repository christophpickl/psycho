= Social Perception

* We might ask ourselves a long list of social questions, like:
** Can I trust him?
** Should I get to know him better?
** Why is she the way she is?
** Why is she doing what she is doing?
* We constantly evaluate others, and try to figure out the reasons for their behavior.

.Social Perception
****
How we form impressions of others, and draw inferences about them.
****

* Remember that episode with Lacie Pound in "Black Mirror" where people would reach other?
** Well, a single-minded pursuit of popularity doesn't always lead to happiness
** This satire exaggerates our current obsession with social media likes and other forms of superficiality.
* We might not use overlays with ratings in an augmented reality, still...
** We use external characteristics to quickly evaluate people and make snap judgements.
** We use indicator like: Clothes, car brand, food (organic, processed, gluten-free).

* We have this fundamental desire to understand people, to explain why others behave as they do.
** Found in our recreational lives: Movies, novels, we eavesdrop on conversations, watch people flirting, and reality TV shows.
** Simply because it fascinates us and enjoy, to think about behavior of others, to figure them out.

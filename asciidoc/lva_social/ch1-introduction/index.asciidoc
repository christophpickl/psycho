= Introducing to social psychology

Why do we help complete strangers? Do we really feel attracted to opposites or are we fooling ourselves? Why do we love the people despite of them hurting us? Why do we simply watch someone committing suicide without helping? How could hundreds of people commit suicide, even killing their own children out of a believe?

== Defining it

Social psychology is the scientific study of:

|=======
| *Social thinking*                 | *Social influence*   | *Social relations*
| How we perceive ourselves/others  | Culture              | Prejudice

|=======

.Social Psychology
****
Study how other people (real or imagined) influence ones thoughts, feelings, behaviors.
****

* The task is to *understand and predict* human behavior.
* Focus on the *influence* other people have on us.
* For example direct attempts for *persuasion*, whether advertisers (techniques to make us buy stuff), friends (wanting us to do stuff) or even bullies (use force to get what they want).

.Social Influence
****
The effect of words/actions/presence of others on our thoughts/feelings/attitudes/behavior.
****

.Social influence even by strangers in a night club

* Social influence is a major part of social psychology.
** It discusses topics like: *conformity, attitudes, and group processes*.
* The mere presence of others, or even *strangers* which whom we are not interacting, has an effect on us.
* We are governed by the imaginary *dis-/approval* of peers/authorities like parents/friends/teachers.
** There are resulting conflicts of beliefs and values once put in different environments (family vs school or work).

====
*Social influences in your daily life*

Imagine a situation with feelings of conflicting interpersonal pressure: A friends to go out watch a movie, but your romantic partner go out for dinner. How do you decide how to act in this situation?
====

=== Versus philosophy, science and common sense

* *Philosophy* is the origin of contemporary psychology.
** It gave insights about the nature of *consciousness*, and how people form *beliefs*.
* Psychology deals with the same questions, but more *scientifically*:
** Using *empirical* questions: Answers derived from experimentation/measurement rather personal opinion.
** We could of course also simply *ask people*, but most often they are *unaware* of the underlying reasons behind their responses and feelings. Those justifications might not be the real reason.
** We can also use *common sense* or folk wisdom, yet, they often *disagree* with one another.
*** For example "_birds of a feather flock together_" (or "_same stays with same_") and on the other hand folk wisdom states "_opposites attract_".
*** Another example would be "_out of sight is out of mind_" versus "_absence makes the heart grow fonder_".
*** There are certain *conditions* where one or the other statement might be true.
** Social psychologists use scientific methods to test assumptions/guesses/ideas in a empirically/systematically way.
* Take for example when a suicide bomber attacks, the popular story says that he must be mentally ill, alienated loner, or a psychopath. As a social psychologist, we would try to understand the circumstances of this otherwise healthy, well-educated, bright person who did that for sake of a religious/political goal.

.Is a suicide attack done because the person is crazy, or because of the believe of some "higher" goal?
image::images/suicide_bomb.jpg[Suicide Bob,600,100]

=== How it differs from its cousins

* Cousins like: biology, neuroscience, sociology, economics and political science.
* All of them examine the determinants of human behavior, but on a different *level of analysis*.
** E.g. neuroscientists operate on the level of genes and hormones, and biologists explain long necks of giraffes based on evolution theory.
* Social behavior has also *genetic determinants*, which evolve through *natural selection*, leading to *evolutionary psychology*.
** Evolution occurs veeery slowly though, thus is our behavior partly result of adaptations to environments in our distant past.
** There is a lively debate about the *testability* of evolutionary hypotheses, as it relies on best guesses and can't be tested.
** E.g. Have giraffes long necks because it was an advantage in fights? This is impossible to test directly...

.Evolutionary Psychology
****
Explain behavior in terms of genetic factor evolved through natural selection.
****

* In *personality psychology* we focus more on traits of people, their *individual differences*.
** For personality and clinical psychologists, the level of analysis is the individual.
** Its disadvantage is that it ignores the powerful role of social influence.
** For example, what is a person "really" like?! Arrogant or charming, shy or extroverted? It's the wrong question, as he is both and neither, depending on the situation.

* For social psychologists, the level of analysis is the person's construal of the situation (shaped by social context).
** For example, why do we hurt others? Look at the how he construes a specific situation: Does he feel frustrated? Was there aggression preceded? What are the conditions he would vent his frustration or restrain himself?

.Construal
****
How we perceive/comprehend/interpret (=construct) the social world.
****

[NOTE.tryit,caption=TRY IT]
====
*Social situations and shyness*

. Think of a friend who is shy. Change your view of "a shy person" to "he is afraid his words might be misunderstood".
. List situations where he will behave shy.
. List situations where he will be outgoing; e.g.: a small group of friends, or sharing interests with a stranger.
. Set up a social environment that will make him comfortable. What is the effect on his behavior?
====

.If someone stands out of conformity, we think of the person being different, rebellious.
image::images/conformity.jpg[Conformity,600,100]

* Other *social sciences* focus more on society, economy, politics and history.
** *Sociology*: Focus on social class, structure and institutions.
** Some overlap, yet main difference is _level of analysis_:
*** Sociology: The group, institution and society at large.
*** Social psychology: The *individual within a group*, institution and society (its influence on the individual).
* Also _what is being explained_ differs: Social psychology identifies *properties* that make us *susceptible* to social influence.
* BUT: Its a young science, developed in the US, thus not yet tested in other cultures.
** *Cross-cultural* research needed; Is it universal? Are their additional variables?
* Personality psychology < Social psychology < Sociology

To sum up, these disciplines are focused on:

* *Biology, Neuroscience*: Genes, hormones, physiological processes.
* *Personality Psychology*: Characteristics that make an individual unique.
* *Social Psychology*: Common psychological processes that make us susceptible to social influence.
* *Sociology*: Groups, organizations, societies.

== The power of the situation

* How do we explain our own and other's behavior?
** Once we get all the information, we don't think of the person as being "nasty", but as an ordinary human under enormous stress.
** Westerners explain behavior in terms of personality.
** Focus is on the fish, not the water around the fish (ignoring the context/situation).

=== Underestimating it

.Fundamental Attribution Error
****
Overestimating internal, underestimate external/situational factors, when explaining people's behavior.
****

* Explaining behavior in terms of *personality traits*, and underestimate the *social influence* and the immediate situation.
* *Why*? It gives us a feeling of false security.
** Sometimes it's just more *comforting* to write off people as flawed.
** It makes us feel like it could *never happen to us*.
** Ironically, it actually increases our vulnerability, as we are less aware of our own susceptibility to destructive social influences.
** We *oversimplify* the problem, and too easily blame the power of social forces which are too *difficult to resist*.
* *Experiment*: The "Wall Street Game" vs "Community Game" by Liberman, Samules and Ross, Stanford University (link:https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167204264004[Paper])
** Check whether we are either cooperative or competitive.
** Tell half the participants the one, the other half the other name of the game.
** We might think it has to do with a person's character, but the name of the game actually had a bigger impact.
** Personality trait made no measurable difference.
** Summed up: The game's title conveyed social normas that trumped personality and shaped player's behavior.

=== Construal importance

* Social situation defined: Specify the *objective properties* of it, and document the resulting behavior. This is exactly what behaviorists would do.

.Behaviorism
****
Behavior can be explained *only* by reinforcing properties of the *environment*.
****

* The pioneer of this school is obviously link:../../people/skinner-burrhus_frederic.html[B.F Skinner].
* A *reinforcing property* of the environment is:
** When behavior is followed by a *reward* (money, attention, praise), then it will more likely *continue*.
** Or by a *punishment* (pain, loss), then it is likely to *stop*.
** Remember link:../../people/pavlov-ivan.html[Pavlov]'s research with dogs (food and the bell), leading to what he called *classical conditioning*.
** Compliance is followed by positive reinforcement.
* No focus was given to cognition/thinking/feeling; they were too vague for them, not observable.
** Thus, they ignored the importance of how people _interpret their environments_.

.Gestalt Psychology
****
Focus on studying how people subjectively perceive their environment (instead the objective, physical attributes of it).
****

* For social psychologists, behavior is not influenced directly by the situation, but by their *construal* of it. (construe = interpret)
* This approach is rooted in *Gestalt psychology*:
** How people perceive the physical world, in a subjective way, how it appears in our minds (the "gestalt", the whole/form).
** Focusing on the *phenomenology* of the perceivers; how an object appears to them.
* It was found by German Jewish link:../../people/lewin-kurt.html[Kurt Lewin], who had a deep interest in the causes/cures of prejudice/ethnic stereotyping during the Nazi regime.

.Optical illusion as an illustration of Gestalt approach to perception: Is it a rabbit or a duck? Objectively it is neither; what matters is how we construe it.
image::images/gestalt-psychology-illusion.jpg[Gestalt illusion,400,100]

* Another early founder of social psychology, link:../../people/heider-fritz[Fritz Heider], observed that "people react to what they think the other person is perceiving/feeling/thinking in addition to what they are doing".
** We are constantly busy guessing the other person's state/motives/thoughts are; and often we are wrong about it.
** Construals are based on things which have no objective relevance.

.Naïve Realism
****
We think we see the world "as it is", underestimating our interpretation.
****

* Lee Ross called a special kind of construal naïve realism, our conviction to see things "as they really are".
** People with opposite political views both think they are right, seeing how things just are.
** Their beliefs color their interpretation.
** We belief other people see the same thing differently, thus _they_ must be biased.
* By being fully aware of this phenomena, the chance for compromise is more likely.
** Asking questions like "How do you see it?" can lead to better negotiations.
* By changing a bit in the way we communicate/advertise, we can modify the construal and thus the chance for support. Making it a personal matter, instead of a dull formal statement.

.Negotiations can be difficult, as we think we see clearly and the other is biased.
image::images/politicians.jpg[Politicians,600,100]

== Basic human motives

* When the need to feel good about ourselves conflicts with the need to be accurate.
** How do we arrive at our subjective impression of the world?
** What are we actually trying to accomplish when interpreting the social world?
** Do we want to see things in a positive light, or be as accurate in our interpretation as possible?
* Two needs are central when we construe the world: feeling good about ourselves, and being accurate.
** Just other basic needs, like: hunger, thirst, fear, control, love, ...
** Often those two conflict with each other; being accurate means to admit I was foolish/immoral.
** And at exactly that point we can get the most valuable insight.
** Leon Festinger emphasize the underlying dynamics of why we respond to the same stimulus in so many different ways.
* *Edward Snowden* (2013), a spy/traitor/criminal or a whistle-blower/patriot/hero?
** Where do those differing construals come from, and what are their consequences?

=== Self-Esteem

* The strong need to feel good (competent/decent) about ourselves.
* If we justify our actions instead of learning from them, it can impede change/self-improvement.
** Our interpretations often serve to make us feel good about ourselves.
** This distortion makes learning from experiences unlikely.
** We redo the same mistakes, as acknowledging our deficiencies is difficult.
** When being bullied (new graduates in US universities), we sometimes love for what we suffered for; and that bullying can even lead to better group cohesiveness.
* An outside observer is able to see more clearly.
* Summed up:
** We want to maintain a positive picture of ourselves; justifying our behavior, sometimes leading to surprising/paradox actions.
** We might even prefer people who made us suffer, instead those who loved us.

.Self-Esteem
****
The evaluation of our self-worth; seeing ourselves as good/competent/decent.
****

=== Social Cognition

* The need to be accurate.
* We sometimes bend reality, but usually don't completely break it, as we are skilled in social cognition.
* We still use mental short-cuts to make judgements.
** We are not perfect in understanding/predicting, as we never know all the facts to judge accurately.
** All those small decisions of life, like what products to buy based on packaging.
*** If you choose the "healthier looking" package, then you stepped in a cognitive trap: You generalized from the cover to the product, instead checking the ingredients table.
** Or bigger decisions like which car to buy, or choosing a partner.

.You might prefer the right cereals, judging it by its packaging; although it would be better to read the ingredients.
image::images/packaging.jpg[Packaging,600,100]

.Social Cognition
****
How we think (select/interpret/remember/use social information) about ourselves/social world -> to make judgements/decisions.
****

== Why study it?

* Social psychology is the study of *social influence*, but why do we want to do that anyway? Because out of *curiosity*.
* Social media is a social psychologist's dream laboratory.
* To contribute to the solution of social problems:
** Kurt Lewin escaped Nazi Germany, and wanted to understand the transformation of his country.
** To reduce violence and prejudice; to increase altruism and tolerance.
** To induce people to conserve resources, practice safe sex, and eat healthier.
** Study effects of violence in media; find effective strategies to resolve conflicts; find ways to raise children's intelligence.
* But also to study happier topics, like: passion, liking, love, and what sustains them.
** Change your self-defeating/misguided behavior, improve relationships, and make better decisions.
* Ask the right questions; study the social world in detail; find truths which are (close to being) universal.

.Does watching violent movies make children more aggressive later on? And if so, what kind of intervention might be beneficial?
image::images/violence_media.jpg[Violence in media,600,100]

== Summary

. *Define* social psychology and how it *differs* from other disciplines.
** Scientific study of how our feeling/thoughts/behaviors are influenced by others.
** Using empirical methods, to discover universal laws.
** Similar to evolutionary psychology, taking genetic factors into account (hard to test experimentally).
** Personality psychologists focus on individual character traits.
** Indeed personalities are different, but social psychologists focus on the power of the situation. The level of analysis is on the individual within the context of a social situation.
** Sociology focuses on society at large (groups, institutions).
. What's the importance of how we *explain/interpret* events/ourselves?
** Never underestimate the power of the situation. Our behavior is influenced by our social environment.
** Fundamental attribution error: overestimate behavior based on personality traits, underestimate social influence. Situations are more powerful than we usually would think.
** A two-way street: People perceive/interpret the social world; we use construals: the world as it is interpreted by us.
. What happens when the need to *feel good* about yourself and being *accurate* conflict?
** Human motives: we want to feel good about ourselves (self-esteem) and be accurate (social cognition) at the same time; which sometimes conflicts.
** Self-esteem: We want to see ourselves as good, competent, decent. For that to preserve we need to distort our perception.
** Social cognition: We need accurate understandings to make effective judgements. We usually act on incomplete/inaccurate interpreted information.
. Why is the study of social psychology *important*?
** Simply to follow our curiosity and fascination.
** To solve social problems.

= Prosocial Behavior

* Think of the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.
** An incredible courage and sacrifice was made by people towards strangers.
** 403 firefighters and police offers died trying to rescue people!

== Motives

.Prosocial Behavior
****
Behavior to benefit another person.
****

* Let's look at the basic motives underlying prosocial behavior, or short: Why do we help?
** How can we explain acts of great self-sacrifice and heroism?
** Especially considering that we also can be so uncaring and heartless at the same time.

.Altruism
****
Wanting to help others, even if it is a "cost game".
****

* We might behave prosocial out of self-interest, secretly hoping we get something in return.
** Altruism is about helping purely with benefit to the other, and none to oneself (maybe even at some cost).
** The heroes of 9/11 are a clear example of that -the people they rescued were not even genetically related to them.

=== Evolutionary Psychology - Instincts and Genes

* How can evolutionary theory explain altruism?
** If all is about our own survival (and reproduction), how does that fit in helping others (at costs for themselves)?
** By putting ourselves at risk, we might produce fewer offspring than when acted selfishly.

.Kin Selection
****
Natural selection made us help genetic relatives.
****

* We can increase the chances that our genes are passed, not only by our own children, but also by genetic relatives.
** This phenomenon is not limited to one gender or a particular culture.
** We seem (based on consistent, anecdotal evidence) to more likely save our sibling than our cousin.
* We don't seem to consciously weight the biological importance, before deciding whether to help, of course.
** It is very deeply ingrained in our human behavior.

.Norm of Reciprocity
****
Helping others, in expectation they will help us back.
****

* This helps us to explain altruism further: We expect something back from others in the future (an investment).
** Imagine being selfish individuals in a cave, it would be more difficult to survive (no fridge), compared cooperating in a group.
** Of course, cooperating to easily might leave us vulnerable of being exploited.
* For reciprocity to be regulated we feel a sensation of gratitude -positive feeling, when we perceive being helped by others.

*The Dictator Game*

* A study on human generosity.
* An experimenter gives you 10 dollars:
** Keep it all, or donate some to a stranger you will never see.
** The donation will be put in an envelope, no one will ever know whether/how much you donated, and no contact between people happens.
** How much (if any) would you donate?
** On average, people gave 2.80 dollars.
* Now a slight twist: The experimenter gives you an envelope with a donation from another participant.
** The change here is, that people will give away roughly the same amount they received as a donation.
** Conclusion: we help others to the same degree that they help us.

=== Social Exchange - Costs and Rewards

* Social exchange theory: Altruistic behavior can be based on self-interest.
** Desire to maximize rewards, minimize costs; just as in an economic marketplace for social rewards instead of money.
* Helping can be rewarding in many ways:
** Increasing the likelihood to be reciprocated, thus acting as an investment into the future.
** It can relieve distress, e.g. of a bystander.
** Receiving social approval from others, leading to an increased feeling of self-worth.
* Helping can be of course costly.
** Physical danger, resulting in pain or embarrassment, taking much time.
* According to social exchange theory, _true altruism_ does not exist.
** Yet, empathy-altruism hypothesis claims that we help out of strong feelings of empathy and compassion.
* We can get gratification in many ways, and we should be thankful that one way is by helping others.
* Prosocial acts help both, the giver and the recipient.
** Still, some argue that all helping stems from self-interest.
** Yet, some social psychologists say that we do have hearts of gold and sometimes help only for the sake of helping.

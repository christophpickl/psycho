= Chapter 11 - Body/Thought/Language Development

_Why would someone, without the inborn tendency to find babys and children cute, deal with developmental psychology? True, for some this might be of no interest, still we can learn a lot about adults by looking on how children developer. As in: "Is a zebra a white horse with black stripes, or a black horse with white stripes?" This can be answered if we look at the animal while it was still young._

=== Physical Development

* Prenatal
** Experiences: Nutritients, stress, prepare for postnatal life
** Phases: Zygotic - Embryonic - Fetal
** Cephal-o-caudal development (head grows first)
** Teratogens
*** Most severe in embryonic phase (most organ systems formed)
*** E.g. coffee, drugs
* Puberty/adolscence
** Male/female differences (changes, time)
** Menarche changes:
*** Since 1960s stable
*** E.g. breast growth (cause: obesity)

.The effects of teratogens on prenatal development. Organ systems and limbs are most sensitive during the first weeks, whereas the CNS stays longer sensitive.

.Growth curves for different bodyparts, expressed in terms of percentage of eventual adult growth.

.Girls begin growth in puberty slightly before boys, leaving both of them substantially different in appearance.

=== Learn about Environment

* Exploring
** Sudy perception/memory thorugh: Look duration, sucking (prefer novel stimuli)
** Obsesses with controlling environment
** Mimic adults (6-12 months)
*** Shared attention
*** Identify danger/safe through adults emotional (facial) expression
* Phsyical principles
** Identify impossibilities (tablet through object; object falls down)
** Object permanence
** Search problem (self-produced locomotion)

=== Theories

* Piaget
** "Little Scientist", act on environment
** Schemes
*** Assimilation: insert
*** Accomodtion: update
** Stages
*** 1. Sensori-motor
*** 2. Pre-operational
**** Egocentrism: "drawing mountain from other person's perspective" experiment
*** 3. Concrete-operational
*** 4. Formal-operational
* Vygotsky
** "Apprentice", interact social-cultural environment
* Information-Processing
** implicit long-term memory
** Explicit: Only through language (encode verbally, by 3 years)
** Episodic memory
** Executive functions improve until 15 years

=== Mind Understanding

* Mental constructs
** "It moves, thus it has psyche"
** Being able to explain people's behavior based on perception/emotion/desire
** False-beliefs capable
* Make-beliefe
** Foundation for false-beliefs understanding
** Reality vs pretense
** Role-play
* Autism
** Impaired social skills; lack of motivation/skillset
* Not playing (make-believe, false-belief)
** Thinking literally, not hypothethically

=== Language

* Universals
** Morphemes: Smallest unit; arbitrary/discrete
** Hierarchical structure: sentences; phonemes (vowel/consonant)
** Grammar:
*** Rules on how to combine units for next level
*** Knowledge is implicit
* Development
** Tendency for over-generalization; e.g. "goed"
** Coo/babble to prepare vocal appartus
** First words by 12 months (overextend words, e.g. "daddy" to all men)

=== Language Acquisition

* Innate mechanisms
** by Chomsky
** LAD (Language Acquisition Device)
** Universal grammar
** Creole/sign language
* External support
** LASS (language Acquisition Support System)
*** Social Context
*** Same rate everywhere: Although LASS variation
** "Motherese": Infant-directed speech
* Bilingual
** Smaller vocabulary each
** Greater executive functions
** Simultan/sequential learning

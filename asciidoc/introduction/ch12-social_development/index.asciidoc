=== Baumrind's disciplinary study

* Example of a link:/introduction/ch2-methods/index.html#sec-design[correlational study].
* Diana Baumrind (1971) studied the relationship between parents' disciplinary styles, and children's behavioral development.
** Three styles: authoritarian, authoritative, permissive.
** Children ratings: cooperation, friendliness, etc.
* Finding: Authoritative parents scored better than others.
** BUT: Only correlation proven, not cause-effect!
** It was not an experiment, tweaking the variables through manipulation.
*** Maybe the children's behavior influenced the parent's style?
*** Maybe the causal relationship goes in both direction?
*** Maybe there is another, third variable at play, e.g.: Genes, income, health, neighbourhood.

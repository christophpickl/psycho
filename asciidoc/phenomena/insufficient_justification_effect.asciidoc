= Insufficient Justification Effect

.Definition
****
We are more likely to do things we don't believe in when given something small, rather big.
****

* The big reward minimizes our cognitive dissonance because it helps with our justification.
* When the extrinsic motivation is low, we tend to reduce cognitive dissonance by generating an intrinsic motivation to explain our behavior.
** We also tend to decline a desired activity, when the threat is mild instead of serious.
* It happens when the reward (threat) is sufficient, so we do it (or not), but insufficient for us to conclude the situation caused our behavior.

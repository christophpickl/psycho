= Decoy Effect

* Consumers have a specific change in preference between two options, when also presented with a third option that is *asymmetrically dominated*
** asymmetrically dominated = inferior in all respects to one option, but only partially inferior to the other option
* Widely used in marketing.
* Example:
** Flash drive A: 400,- 300 MB (target: what the salesman wants to sell)
** Flash drive B: 300,- 200 MB (competitor: what the salesman doesn't prefer)
** Now, presented with C: 450,- 250MB
*** Totally worse than A (more expensive, less storage)
*** But partially worse than B (much more expensive, bit more storage)

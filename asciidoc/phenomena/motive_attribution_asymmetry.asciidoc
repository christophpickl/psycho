= Motive Attribution Asymmetry

Motive attribution asymmetry for love vs. hate drives intractable conflict

.Definition
****
We attribute our own group's aggression more to love than to hate, but the other group's aggression more to hate than to love.
****

* Or differently put: We attribute our ingroup's action to ingroup love more than outgroup hate, and attribute their outgroup's actions to outgroup hate more than ingroup love.
** Or simply put: The enemies are always wrong and the opposite of us.
* This leads us to a belief that makes us unwilling to negotiate and vote for compromise solutions.
* Examples are political discussions (left/right, conservative/liberal, democrats/republicans) or national conflicts (Israel/Palestine) despite the availability of reasonable compromise solutions.
** Understanding this bias and how to resolve it can contribute to conflict resolution on a global scale.

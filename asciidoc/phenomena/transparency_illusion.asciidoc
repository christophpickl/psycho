* A cognitive bias, also known as "The Illusion of Transparency".
* Definition: *We overestimate how much others know about our mental states* (internal thoughts/emotions).
** E.g. when you give a talk and are nervous, that others immediately will see that you are nervous (self- vs other-perception).
** Or when you are lying, how well others will be able to detect your lie.
** When you eat something that tastes bad, that your disgust will be apparent to others.
* It's basically due to a natural egocentric bias; we see the world from our very own perspective and it's hard to adjust that.

== Counteract

* Just be being aware of it, helps.
* Use some "self-distancing" techniques (vividly imagine how others observe you from a different perspective than your own).
* Get feedback from others to confirm/disprove your transparency assumptions.
* Slow down your reasoning process and create optimal conditions for rational thinking.

== Similar Biases

* Another manifestation of it is the _observer's illusion of transparency_, which works the other way round: We overestimate how well we understand other's mental states.
* Similar to the _illusion of asymmetric insight_, where we think we know better then the person himself what's going on inside of him.
* It is partially the reason for the link:bystander_effect.html[bystander effect].
* When we think wrongly we know ourselves, but others' introspections are unreliable, we call it an _introspection illusion_, an illusion of superiority.

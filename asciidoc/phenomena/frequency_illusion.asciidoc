= Frequency Illusion

Also known as the  "Baader-Meinhof phenomenon".

.Definition
****
Something that recently came to one's attention, suddenly seems to appear with a very high frequency shortly afterward.
****

* Cognitive bias where we notice a concept/word/product more frequently after recently becoming aware of it.
* Reality though is, we just ignored it before that -our brain filtered out back then irrelevant sensory information.
* Possible causes: selective attention, confirmation bias, recency illusion, or split-category effect.

== Examples

* You learned new word, suddenly it seems to appear everywhere -the brain being more aware of it.
* You bought a camper (or shoes, brand, etc.), and then think "everyone else also suddenly bought a camper" as you see them every on the highway, yet they were always there, you just weren't aware of them as they got filtered out as irrelevant.

= Frequency Illusion

* a.k.a. Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon
* Something that recently came to one's attention, suddenly seems to appear with a very high frequency shortly afterwards.
** Reality though is, we just ignored it before that.
* E.g. buying a camper, and then we think "everyone else also suddenly bought campers", yet they were always there, we just weren't aware of them as they got filtered out as irrelevant.

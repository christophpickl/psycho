= Regression toward the mean

Also called "regression to the mean", "reversion to the mean", "reversion to mediocrity", or "return to average/normal".

.Definition
****
Statistical phenomena when a random sample is extreme, the next sample is more likely to be closer to the mean.
****

* Simple speak: Things even out over time (where ever there is luck/chance/randomness involved).
* Also made famous by psychologist Daniel Kahneman.

== Example

A sports coach congratulates his student, and everytime he does so, the student performs worse.
On the other hand, every time he angrily criticises him, he does better next time.
Is the correct conclusion to stop congratulating and only criticise them?
No, as peak performance (whether extra-ordinarily good or bad) is due to an un/lucky day, so no matter the response to it, the next day it will most likely return to average performance.

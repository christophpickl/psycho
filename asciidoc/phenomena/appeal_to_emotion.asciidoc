* Informal fallacy, which tries to irrelevant emotions or distracting from the facts of the argument (a so-called "red harring").
* Sometimes a good (logically coherent) argument may inspire or have an emotional aspect, which is ok.
** The difference is, with this fallacy the emotion is used _instead_ of a logical argument.
** Or to hide that there is no compelling rational reason for one's position.
* It's a very common and effective argument tactic, as everyone (except sociopaths) are affected by emotion.
* It includes: Appeal to consequences/fear/flattery/pity/ridicule/spite/envy/hatred/pride/...

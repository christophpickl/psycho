When we focus too much on specific details and ignore overall probabilities.
****

* We tend to ignore the base rate (general prevalence) in favor of the individuating information.
* It's a specific form of the more general extension neglect

** You might think therefor that he is more likely to be a librarian than a salesperson.
** Although there are far more salespeople than librarians overall.
** Hence, making it more likely that the friend is actually a salesperson.
* At a party, many people wearing red shirts, thus incorrectly assuming most guests are wearing red shirts.

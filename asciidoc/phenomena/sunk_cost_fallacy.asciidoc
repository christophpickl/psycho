= Sunk Cost Fallacy

Also called the "Concorde fallacy": the British and French governments took their past expenses on the costly supersonic jet as a rationale for continuing the project, as opposed to "cutting their losses".

.Definition
****
Believing that past investments (i.e., sunk costs) justify further expenditures into failed ventures.
****

* Throwing good money after bad, instead of cutting one's losses.
* Of course, as stopping the investment, would mean to acknowledge our losses we already made, which is painful.
** So we avoid experiencing this painful truth, and continue lying to ourselves.

== Examples

* We remain in failing relationships because we "have already invested too much to leave".
* War must continue because lives will have been sacrificed in vain unless victory is achieved.

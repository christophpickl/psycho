****
Seeing meaningful connections between unrelated things.

* Thus a stereotype can lead us to expect certain groups and traits to fit together, and then to overestimate the frequency with which these correlations actually occur.
** E.g. "If he's bad ... then ... all of them must be bad!"

== Pareidolia

* Another type of apophenia, where we see images of animals in the clouds for example.
* Related to anthropomorphism: Assigning human things (traits, emotions, intentions) to non-human things.

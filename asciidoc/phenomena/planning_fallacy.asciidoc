= Planning fallacy

.Definition
****
When we totally underestimate the time we need to complete a task.
****

* We even do that when we know, based on our past experiences, that we usually underestimate the time needed.
* We do that only for our own tasks, not for others.
** Outsiders usually have a pessimistic bias, overestimating the time needed.
* An expanded definition includes that it not only concerns time, but also costs (cost overruns) and risks of future actions and  overestimate the benefits (benefit shortfalls).
* Related to the link:optimism_bias.html[optimism bias].

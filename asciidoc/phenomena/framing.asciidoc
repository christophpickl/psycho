= Framing Effect

.Definition
****
Drawing different conclusions from the same information, depending on its representation.
****

* When the way information is presented, influences our decision.
** Even if the actual content remains the same.
** The phrasing is of relevance!

== Examples

* Something is 80% healthy VS 20% unhealthy.
* First let people read a list, group A words associated with age, group B not. Afterwards, group A is observed to walk slower on the corridor.
* Similar to this, let people interpret the word "bank" (financial or sitting), and changed only by presence of a suitcase in the room.

== Contrast Effect

* The enhancement/reduction of a perceived stimulus, when compared with a recently observed contrasting object.
** E.g.: Seeing a picture of a wombat, thinking it's all cute and small; and then seeing a picture of it compared to a human.

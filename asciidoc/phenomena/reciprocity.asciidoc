= Reciprocity

* The science of giving ("the theory of reciprocity" / "social reciprocity")
** Receiving a gift leads to an internal conflict, resolved by giving something back.
** Basically it makes us feel guilty to receive more than we gave, and we want to elevate ourselves from that guilt.
* The Coca Cola *experiment* (most famous experiment on reciprocity)
** A confederate gave a participant Cola (or not) and later asked for raffle ticket (with dramatic impact).
* *Application*:
** Donation projects first give some small thing for free (flowers, colored envelopes) before asking for money.
** In shopping malls, we get small, free samples, and then buy a full package to compensate for our previous consumption.
** Fair trades, and receive a bag with free goodies.
* The usage of this can be *ethically* questionable.
**  Is it "intentionally manipulation"? Or genuine want to give a sample for persuasion of the quality of the product?

= Ben Franklin Effect

* An example of counterattitudinal behavior, and convincing oneself to like someone in order to reduce cognitive dissonance.
** If we do a small favor towards a person we don't like, our behavior and our attitude is not in alignment (dissonance).
** In order to bring things in alignment again (reduce dissonance), we change our attitude by liking that person.
** Next time you want someone to like you, who doesn't, ask them for a small favor ;)
* Helping others might change our self-concept and our attitudes.

== Origin

* A political strategy used by Benjamin Franklin.
** He asked an opponent to borrow him a book, and returned it promptly with a thank-you letter.
** After doing so, that opponent became a good friend.
* He said: "_He that has once done you a kindness, will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged._" (Franklin, 1868/1900)

= Outcome Bias

* Judge decision's efficacy based on how things turn out (result, outcome) even if it was based on pure luck (doing things out of intuition/gut feeling)
** Or in other words: Decide whether an action is right/wrong based on the outcome. ("Consequentialism" and link:hindsight_bias.html[Hindsight Bias])
* Rarely examine conditions during time of the decision, after it was made.

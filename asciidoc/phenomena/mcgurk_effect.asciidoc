= McGurk Effect

This perceptual phenomenon, named after Harry McGurk, happens when what you see and what you hear someone is saying doesn't match. The paper this illusion was first published (1976) was called therefore also "Hearing Lips and Seeing Voices".

In this case, due to *visual dominance*, what we see matters more. The same sound thus can seem different to us, depending on which lip movement we see.

The video below demonstrates this effect quite nicely: Is it a "fa" or a "pa" sound? Well, depends on what you see ðŸ˜‰

= Projection Bias

* We assume other people have the same beliefs/values/desires as ourselves.
* E.g. believing most people enjoy spicy food, you project your own preference onto others, and make assumptions about their tastes without asking them directly.

== Alternatively

* Overestimate how much our future self will share our current preferences/thoughts/values.
** "I am never going to regret this when I'm older."
* It leads to suboptimal choices.

= Confirmation Bias

It's just a part of our human nature: Our unconsciousness leads us to always try to confirm our own point of view. Very useful shortcuts in our brains, creating patterns (like stereotypes, generalized thoughts) which are stored in our unconsciousness.

We are basically all self-righteous hypocrites. Yet, good news there (as with all other biases as well): By being aware of these mechanisms, some level of self-reflection skills and a bunch of courage, we can counteract this bias. Just sometimes say "I am wrong" or "I don't know". And try to employ a scientific, philosophical, scholastic approach to evaluate the pros and cons of all viewpoints.

* It all happened beginning of the 20th century in Germany.
* The owner of the "smart" horse Hans, Mr. von Osten, claimed it can solve unbelievable tasks.
** He taught it over 4 years just like they would educate young children in schools.
** Due to lack of vocal apparatus, answers were encoded into hoof taps, or head shaking.
** It was trained mathematics, history, geography, literature, science and other scholarly disciplines.
** Hans could even answer questions in foreign languages he never heard before.
* Everyone *believed* it could do these sophisticated intellectual tasks.
** Especially the owner genuinely believed it, and there was no evidence of trickery.
** Hans could even solve these tasks with his owner being absent.
** Several circus trainers examined Hans and could not find anything wrong.
* The psychologist *Oskar Pfungst* did his research and found out the truth...
** By using *blindfolds*, Hans could not provide the right answer anymore.
** At the end it turned out *unaware cues* of the audience (e.g. nodding) gave the right answer.
* An example now known as *observer-expectancy effect*.
** Subjects behave differently due to influence of observer.
** Observer's unconscious cues reveal the intention of the experiment.
* This story lead to an increased awareness of the importance of *skepticism*:
** Critical thinking
** Scientific testing
** Testing over claiming
* As well as the importance of *controlled conditions*.
** Rule out alternatives (e.g. using blinders).

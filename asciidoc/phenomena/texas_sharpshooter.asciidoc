* This informal, 'false cause' fallacy is committed when we ignore differences in data, but overemphasize similarities.
** Based of this reasoning, false conclusions are inferred.
* Clusters naturally appear by chance, but don't necessarily indicate that there is a causal relationship.
* The philosophical/rhetorical application of the multiple comparisons problem (in statistics) and apophenia (in cognitive psychology: the tendency to perceive meaningful connections between unrelated things).
* Related to the tendency in human cognition to interpret patterns where there are none (clustering illusion).

== Example

"The makers of some candy drinks point to research showing that of the five countries where those drinks sell the most units, three of them are in the top ten healthiest countries on Earth, therefore the drinks are healthy."

= Ingroup Bias

.Definition
****
Treat people better which we perceive to be members of our own group.
****

* Alias "Ingroup Favoritism".
* We favor members of our own group and discriminate against those who are not part of it.
* Observable in all kinds of groups: Sports, politics, religion, ...

== Reason

* Happens because we encounter/interact with ingroup people more often than with strangers; make them seem more unique, and outsiders more boring/conforming.

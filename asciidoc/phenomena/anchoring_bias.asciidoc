== Characteristics

* *Difficulty of avoiding*: Even when we know (and explicitly made aware!) it's wrong (and/or offered monetary incentives!), it impacts us.
** E.g. Did Gandhi die before/after age 9 VS 140? Clearly wrong, still average guess then will be 50 VS 67.
* *Durability*: It just won't leave our head. Anchoring effect may precede link:priming[Priming]
* *In groups*: Groups are worse than individuals, as pre-existing biases are amplified in decision-making process. Yet, some groups perform better than individual members.
* This is why first impressions matter so much! The anchored image will be hard to change.
* Multiple theories exist about the *causes* of anchoring, no consensus yet as to which is best, like: Anchoring-and-adjusting, selective accessibility, attitude change and extremeness aversion.
* Influencing factors are: mood, personal experience, personality, cognitive ability and overconfidence.
* It involves other biases like: Common source bias, conservatism bias, functional fixedness and law of the instrument.

== Example 1

* You come to me, and want to buy a car
* You ask me, how much, and I reply 30k
* Next week you come again, and I tell you 20k
* This time it seems like a very cheap price to you, right?!

Now imagine the first time I would have said 10k instead of 30k...

== Example 2

* I want you to guess whether the average size of trees is more or less than 5 meters.
* Additionally I ask you to estimate the average size.
* Now clearly, you will pick a number roughly around the given 5 meters, won't you?!

== Example 3

* link:../people/kahnemann-daniel[Daniel Kahneman] and Amos Tversky researched this phenomena with several studies.
* Participants were asked to calculate the result of one of two within 5 seconds: 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 or 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
* Because of the limited time, they had to guess.
* For the first instruction the median of the guesses was 512, and for the second 2,250 (the correct answer is 40,320).

* A cognitive bias, where people "hop on the bandwagon" regardless of the underlying evidence.
** Do/believe what others/the majority do/believe. Following the rest without thinking -you sheep!
** As in: "_If he jumps out of the window, would you too?_"
** We do so, even when we don't believe (or like) it ourselves.
* Wanting to be part of the majority (meetings, voting, stock market), as an attempt of validation.
** In social psychology called link:groupthink.html[groupthink]: 9 of 10 agree, and the last person won't speak up.
** Has to do with social conformity, as we want so much to "fit in" with peers.
** E.g. fashion trends (gaining access to a particular social group)
* The flaw in this argument is that the popularity of an idea has absolutely no bearing on its validity.
** If it did, then the Earth would have made itself flat for most history to accommodate this popular belief.
* It can spread quickly through its self-reinforcing mechanism and result in a positive feedback loop.
** Areas where it happens: Politics, economics (financial markets, microeconomics), medicine, sports, social networking, fashion.
* The reverse is also possible: *reverse bandwagon effect* (a.k.a. "snob effect")
** Avoid doing something, because others are doing it.
* With today's social media influence, this phenomena can be observed very, very often.

== Reasons

Possible reasons why people do it:

. Efficiency -- A mental shortcut/heuristic, to make decisions quicker.
. Normative social influence (belonging) -- Wanting to *conform* to fit in/get approval from others; social inclusion/acceptance.
. Informational social influence -- Assuming others may know something better, supporting popular beliefs as "the majority must be right" (in addition to lack of information)
. Wanting to be a winner -- E.g. voting for a candidate who is in the lead.
. Fear of missing out

.How a bandwagon looks like.
image::bandwagon_wagon.png[A Bandwagon,300,100]

* A literal bandwagon is a wagon that carries musicians/band during a parade/circus.
* The phrase "jump on the bandwagon" first appeared in US politics in 1848.
** A circus clown invited a politician to join his circus bandwagon.
** That politician became more successful, and others should join him if they want to be associated with such success.
* Although the phrase is known rather long, understanding of the theoretical background is rather recent.
** In the 1950s, link:../people/asch-solomon.html[Asch]'s conformity experiments led to better understanding.

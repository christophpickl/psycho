= Bandwagon Effect

* Doing/believing what others do/believe. Following the rest without thinking -you sheep!
* As in: If he jumps out of the window, would you too?
* Wanting to be part of the majority (meetings, voting, stock market).
** As in "group think": 9 of 10 agree, last person won't speak up.

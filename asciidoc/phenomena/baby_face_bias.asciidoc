= Baby-Face Bias

.Definition
****
People (and things) with baby-faced features are seen as more naive, helpless, kind, warm and honest.
****

* Or in short: "You look like a baby, you have the personality of a baby."
* It's usually about round features, but to be more precise: high/smooth forehead, large eyes, small/upturned nose, protruding ears, short chin, lighter skin/hair.
* Effective when used to in commercials to pretend innocence and honesty; e.g. for personal testimonials.
** Toy producers use this to aim their products at children (dolls and toys with huge eyes).
** Of disadvantage though when dealing with speaking authoritatively.
* The bias is found across all age ranges, cultures, and many mammalian species.

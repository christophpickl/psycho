* It is an epistemological razor that serves as a general rule for rejecting certain knowledge claims.
* It implies that the burden of proof regarding the truthfulness of a claim lies with the one who makes the claim.
** If this burden is not met, then the claim is unfounded, and its opponents need not argue further in order to dismiss it.
* Christopher Hitchens used this phrase specifically in the context of refuting religious belief.

* When we assess truth, we either go for A) understanding it, using logic and how this new information compares to what we already know or B) how familiar it feels, as more repeated conclusions seem more truthful to us.
** Thus, familiarity can overpower rationality.
** Paradoxically, hearing repetitively that something is wrong, can lead to make use feel it's right.

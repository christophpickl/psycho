= Phenomena

 To know that you do not know is highest.
 To not know but think you know is flawed.
 Only when one recognizes the fault as a fault can one be without fault.
 The sages are without fault.
 Because they recognize the faults as a fault.
 That is why they are without fault.

-- Laozi

== Biases

Some human flaws and unique traits, thanks to social psychology, well known due to pop-psychology, a list of (more or less) funny effects, illusions & co. Useful to know for everyone to try to see a bit more clearly:

* link:availability_bias.html[Availability Bias]
* Baseline (Kahnemann); very difficult for humans

== Cases

Some people's medical cases (accidents and other abnormalities in medical history) have lead to a leap in the understanding of the mind. These "unintentional experiments" would have been otherwise impossible to do, due to ethical restrictions. On the one hand fascinating from the standpoint of science, on the other hand tragic stories from an empathetical standpoint.

* link:HM.html[H.M.] -- The man who was unable to form new memory. Memento anyone?
* link:phineas_gage.html[Phineas Gage] -- Blast an iron stick through the brain, survive, and become a legend.

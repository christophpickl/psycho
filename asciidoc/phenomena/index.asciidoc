= Phenomena

 To know that you do not know is highest.
 To not know but think you know is flawed.
 Only when one recognizes the fault as a fault can one be without fault.
 The sages are without fault.
 Because they recognize the faults as a fault.
 That is why they are without fault.

-- Laozi

PS: Francis Bacon used to call "cognitive biases" also "idols of the mind".

== Cases

Some people's medical cases (accidents and other abnormalities in medical history) have lead to a leap in the understanding of the mind. These "unintentional experiments" would have been otherwise impossible to do, due to ethical restrictions. On the one hand fascinating from the standpoint of science, on the other hand tragic stories from an empathetical standpoint.

* link:phineas_gage.html[Phineas Gage] -- Blast an iron stick through the brain, survive, and become a legend.

== Studies

Famous studies and experiments everyone should know of.

* Pavlov's dog
* Skinner's cat box
* Thorndike's puzzle box
* link:clever_hans.html[Clever Hans]
* ... decision watch spinning, action potential measured before conscious
* ... split brain, see/touch different objects, rationalizing (freud?!)
* ... observe car accident, touch vs crash, ask later, different memories (cognitive psychology)
* ... person sits in a room, smoke appears, no one acts, he doesn't act
* ... social conformity; stand up when sound; like monkeys banana up tree, once rain, now aggressive; see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8BkzvP19v4
* ... marshmellow kids experiment; delayed gratification
* London Cab driver hippocampus
* ... dot on forehand, look in mirror, to be able to identify oneself
* ... object permanence with babies, baby looking longer when object should not have been able to turn that far because of obstacle (understanding of physical laws, object standing on the edge and should fall)
* ... mind of others: doll play with children; does he know what i know or not? (ability to lie)

== Tests

* Strange Situation Test
* Implicit Association Test

== Others

* London train lights; red/orange-/orange-orange/green; serial VS parallel processing

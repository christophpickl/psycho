 To know that you do not know is highest.
 To not know but think you know is flawed.
 Only when one recognizes the fault as a fault can one be without fault.
 The sages are without fault.
 Because they recognize the faults as a fault.
 That is why they are without fault.

-- Laozi

 Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.

-- Hanlon's razor

 I wrote a book about cognitive biases, even won the nobel prize, and studying all those biases made me not a single bit less prone to making them. The only thing that would truly help is curiousity and humbleness.

-- Daniel Kahneman

== Biases, Fallacies, Effects, Heuristics, Phenomena, Mental Shortcuts and Other Mind Traps

Some human flaws and unique traits, thanks to social psychology, well known due to pop-psychology, a list of (more or less) funny effects, illusions & co. Useful to know for everyone to try to see a bit more clearly. Francis Bacon used to call cognitive biases also: "idols of the mind".

They have developed as a result of evolutionary processes and social conditioning we all share. We are not irrational, flawed beings, but rather highlights the compelxity of human cognition and the importance of continuous learning and self-improvement.

They can be observed in everyday life and have far-reaching consequences on individual and social level. Remember that no one is immune to cognitive biases, but being aware of them and taking active steps to mitigate their impact can lead to a more empathetic, inclusive, and well-rounded perspective.

== Experiments, Studies, Cases and Tests

* Strange Situation experiment (attachment style)

=== The Classics

The classics among psychological studies.
Some of them were done in times were ethical standards were lower than those of today.
That gave them the advantage to have possibilities we don't have today.
Yet of course, all for the good of being ethical correct.

Watch out though, some of them do not comply with today's standards about proper research methods.
Some of them could not be reproduced anymore, raising a question of their validity.
Up to concerns about whether researches deliberately manipulated, or at least unconsciously led their confirmation bias and their desire to prove themselves right to wrong conclusions.

=== Cases

Some people's medical cases (accidents and other abnormalities in medical history) have lead to a leap in the understanding of the mind. These "unintentional experiments" would have been otherwise impossible to do, due to ethical restrictions. On the one hand fascinating from the standpoint of science, on the other hand tragic stories from an empathetical standpoint.

= Phenomena

 To know that you do not know is highest.
 To not know but think you know is flawed.
 Only when one recognizes the fault as a fault can one be without fault.
 The sages are without fault.
 Because they recognize the faults as a fault.
 That is why they are without fault.

-- Laozi

=== Cases

Some people's medical cases (accidents and other abnormalities in medical history) have lead to a leap in the understanding of the mind. These "unintentional experiments" would have been otherwise impossible to do, due to ethical restrictions. On the one hand fascinating from the standpoint of science, on the other hand tragic stories from an empathetical standpoint.

* link:HM.html[H.M.] -- The man who was unable to form new memory. Memento anyone?
* link:phineas_gage.html[Phineas Gage] -- Blast an iron stick through the brain, survive, and become a legend.
* link:kitty_genovese.html[Kitty Genovese] -- Getting murdered and no one cares
* Metro station on fire -- No one fet responsible

=== Miscellaneous

* blue/brown eye experiment
* Nodding/shaking head, influencing judgement.
* Judging something while stick in mouth (forcing a smile).
* ... decision watch spinning, action potential measured before conscious
* ... split brain, see/touch different objects, rationalizing (freud?!)
* ... observe car accident, touch vs crash, ask later, different memories (cognitive psychology)
* ... person sits in a room, smoke appears, no one acts, he doesn't act

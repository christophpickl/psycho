= Strange Situation Test

* A procedure developed by link:../people/ainsworth-mary.html[Mary Ainsworth] to test their attachment style.

== The procedure

1. A child with her mother in a room, with toys.
2. A stranger enters.
3. The mother leaves the child, which then would start to cry.
4. The mother returns.

What's being observed are the following factors:

* How much the child played.
* How the child behaved when the mother left.
* How anxious the child is while being alone.
* How the child behaved when the mother returned.

Based on the answers, four patterns of attachment can be concluded:

1. Secure
2. Anxious-avoidant, insecure
3. Anxious-ambivalent/resistant, insecure
4. Disorganized/disoriented

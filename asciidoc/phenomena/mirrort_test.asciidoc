* A.k.a. mark test, mirror self-recognition (MSR) test, red spot technique, rouge test, or red-dye test.
* A behavioral technique developed in 1970 by American psychologist Gordon Gallup.
* Checking whether an animal has visual self-recognition (got self-awareness).
** Yet, for some animals this test is inappropriate (better use songs or scents).

= Barnum Effect

* When statements are too vague (personality checks; horoscopes?), virtually everyone can find a past behavior that is similar to (representative of) the feedback.
* You should remind yourself more often of "how many times did I NOT feel or act this way".
* Named after the circus owner and showman P.T. Barnum.
* It uses the representativeness heuristic.

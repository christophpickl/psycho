* When statements are too vague, virtually everyone can find a past behavior that is similar to (representative of) the feedback.
** We believe general statements about ourselves as true, even if they actually apply to many people.
* Think for example about *personality tests* like Meyer Briggs, horoscopes predicting your future, fortune-teller and palm readers.
** Descriptions are so vaguely written, so that they apply to everyone.
** They also often include both qualities (e.g.: "you are this, but also that").
** These tests arbitrarily draw a line somewhere (e.g. introvert vs extravert, but we are rather scattered among a scale).
* It uses the link:representativeness_heuristic.html[representativeness heuristic].

== Examples

    You are the quiet type, but you are a great judge of character.

    You've got a bubbly personality, but you can be serious too.

    You're very intuitive and naturally analytical.

    You're not living up to your full potential.

== Motivation

* People have the need to easily understand the world.
* It helps our simplified, stereotypical thinking in categorizations ("women are just like this or that").
** Yet, it doesn't account to people massive diversity.

== Counteract

* You should remind yourself more often of "how many times did I NOT feel or act this way".

== Origin

* Named after the circus owner and showman link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._T._Barnum[P.T. Barnum].
* He wanted to be able to offer everyone something.
** As people are all different, he offered excitement but also fun for others.
* If from everything is offered at least a bit, no one will be disappointed.

= Availability Bias

* Also "availability heuristic" is a mental shortcut, an over-emphasizing of available information
* Something that comes more easily to mind (more recently acquired) most be more right.
** E.g. terrorism is the biggest threats (and so are sharks) as that's what we are mostly exposed to in news; an inflated danger. Yet, TVs cause 55 times more deaths (they fall on people hey!). More likely to killed by a cow or a coconut than by terrorism. 130 times more likely to be killed by the police.
* Decisions not based on facts/statistics but by news ("when it bleeds, it leeds") and stories.

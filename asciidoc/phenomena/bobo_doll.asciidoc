= Bobo Doll Experiment

* Trying to study aggressive behavior through modeling, conducted by link:../people/bandura-albert.html[Albert Bandura] in 1961.
* The goal was to show that aggression can be explained in terms of _social learning theory_ (at least in part).
** It claims that people learn largely through observation, imitation and modelling.
* Question being also: What's the impact on children watching violence (in TV and computer games)?

== Setup

* Three groups of 72 children (age 3-5):
.. Watching people being aggressive (punching, kicking, tossing, pushing down, yelling) towards a doll for 10 minutes.
.. Watching people being neutral to it (playing with other toys).
.. A control group.
* The adult model later was either rewarded/punished/no consequences for physically abusing the Bobo doll.
* Later measured how much children expressed aggressiveness (physical and verbal) towards it.

== Conclusions

* Exposing children to aggressive models increased likelihood of physically aggressive behavior (compared to those not being exposed). Which was what Bandura wanted to prove.
** Boys are slightly more aggressive.
** Same-sex models have more influence on children.
* Exposure to aggressive modeling is NOT cathartic (draining the viewer's aggressive drive), as believed for a long time.
* It increased attraction to guns, although it was never modelled.

== Criticism

* Some experts criticize its ecological and external validity.
* In a 1990 repeated study, novelty alone (not yet seen the Bobo doll) increased aggressive behavior five times, thus being a third variable.
* Social learning theory ignores biological/evolutionary drives (a person's biological state, DNA, brain development, learning differences).
* Children under eight have underdeveloped frontal lobes, thus not being able to separate reality from fantasy.
* Exposure and imitation happened immediately after each other, thus not looking on long-term effects.
* Not aligned with today's ethical standards.

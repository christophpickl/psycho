= The looking-glass self

* Definition: How we think others perceive us, used as a mirror for perceiving ourselves.
** So not really how others really see us, but how we imagine they see us.
* By sociologist Charles H. Cooley (1902)
* E.g. telling women they are bad in math, they start (dis-)identifying themselves with this, and score lower (some for minorities like black people). BUT: If told it wasn't a math test, or similar, they score higher. Just a matter of believe.

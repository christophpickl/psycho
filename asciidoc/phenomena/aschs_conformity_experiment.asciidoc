* Look at the image above: You might think immediately that the answer is obvious, and when anyone who would be asked, would say C, but that's not so under all circumstances.
* link:../people/asch-solomon.html[Solomon Asch] conducted 1951 an experiment which showed that peer pressure can be strong enough to change our perception, and make us believe things that are not true.
** Each participant was sent into a room with a few other people which were actually confederates.
** The whole group was shown two cards, similar as the one above.
** Each person should then say out loud the answer, the real participant coming last.
** After a while, the group started to give wrong answers, leaving a choice of either going against the group, or against the truth.
*** All in order to avoid the discomfort of disagreeing with the group.
* The result: 23% always gave the wrong answer, 72% conformed at least once, and 5% completely succumbed to peer pressure.
** Yet, if there is only a single person giving the right answer, participants are way more likely to stay with the truth (having an allied).
** Long story short: If 3 people say something obviously wrong, and no one disagrees with them, most of us will agree with the wrong statement, as we need to fit in.
* It's especially having an effect among women and homogenous peer groups.
** Question remains: How strong is this conformity effect on social media?
* Two different types of conformity:
** Informational: Agreeing with the group because they convinced us that they are right.
** Normative: Agreeing with the group because we are afraid that they will disapprove of us being deviant.
* Also, having to write down the answer (instead speaking out publicly) drastically decreases the pressure to conform.

* A logical/informal fallacy (or literary device in mystery fiction) leading the audience to a false conclusion.
** Similar to link:straw_man.html[straw man] which distorts the other's position, the red herring seems plausible yet irrelevant; a diversionary tactic.
* It can happen intentionally (rhetorical strategy in politics) or unintentionally.
* Origin: Using a strong-smelling smoked fish to divert and distract hounds from chasing a rabbit.

== Example

"I think we should make the academic requirements stricter for students. I recommend you support this because we are in a budget crisis, and we do not want our salaries affected." The second sentence, though used to support the first sentence, does not address that topic.

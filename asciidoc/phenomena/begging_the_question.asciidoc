= Begging the Question

.Definition
****
Presenting a premise of an argument which contains (a in/direct) assumption that the conclusion is true.
****

* An informal, logical fallacy; in classical rhetoric and logic; literal translation from Aristotle would be something like "asking for the initial thing".
* Presenting a circular argument (circular reasoning); thus being a logically incoherent argument.
* Happens when people have their assumptions very deep ingrained in their minds, so that they take it for given.

== Examples

* Circular reasoning is bad mostly because it's not very good.
* People have known for thousands of years that the earth is round. Therefore, the earth is round.
* Coca Cola is the most popular soft drink in the world. Therefore, no other soft drink is as popular as Coca Cola.

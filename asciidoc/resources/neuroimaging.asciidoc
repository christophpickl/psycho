Methods to...

* observe behavior when stimulated/damaged
* observe neurons when doing a task

Techniques can be based on electrical (EEG), anatomical or metabolic (fMRI) procedures.

|=======
| Name | Method

2+| Electrical

| EEG (Electro-Encephalo-Graphy)
| Scalp electrodes record electrical activity of the cortex

| ERPs (Event-Related Potentials)
| Encephalographic measure of local changes to specific stimuli.

| MEG (Magento-Encephalo-Graphy)
| Detects magnetic field changes, produced by cortical electrical activity.

| TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation)
| Blocking electrical activity by magnetic fields to localize brain functions.

| tDCS (Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation)
| Stimulating electrical activity, by weak electrical currents, to localize brain functions.

2+|Anatomical

| MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
| Measuring energy changes after magnetic field exposure.

| DTI (Diffusion Tension Imaging)
| Measures diffusion of water, imaging white matter tracts.

2+|Metabolic

| PET (Positron Emission Tomography)
| Measures glucose/oxygen by following an injected radioactive tracer.

| fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
| Measures blood flow changes, thus indirectly measuring metabolic activity.

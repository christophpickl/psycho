CT (computed tomography) scan is a modern medical imaging technique which can be used for the whole body. It has a rotating X-ray tube and the resulting images ("slices") will be put together in software to result in a 3D image of the body.

== Electrical

=== EEG

Electro-Encephalo-Graphy is a technique to record electrical activity of the surface layer (cortex) of the brain via multiple *scalp electrodes*. It measures voltage fluctuations (neural oscillations, or in popular speak "brain waves") resulting from ionic current with the neurons.

It is most often used to diagnose epilepsy (a test lasting about 30 minutes), which causes abnormalities in EEG readings, but also sleep disorders and verifying brain death in comatose patients. MRI and CT has replaced usage to diagnose tumors, storke and other brain disorders.

Pros:

* Non-invasive (When invasive electrodes are used, it's often called "intracranial EEG")
* Millisecond-range temporal resolution (not possible with CT, PET or MRI)
* Relatively tolerant of subject movement
* Mobile equipment (compared to fMRI, SPECT, PET, MEG), relatively cheap and silent

Cons:

* Low spatial resolution (requires intense interpretation to just hypothesize what areas are activated by a particular response).
* Takes long time to prepare the subject (lots of precisely placed electrodes with some gel/paste).
* Can't go beyond the cortex.
* Signal-to-noise ratio is poor, so much data is needed to get sophisticated analysis.

.EEG reflects electrical activity of neurons by electrodes placed on the skull.

=== ERPs

Encephalographic measure of local changes, *averaging the EEG* activity, time-locked to some stimulus; often used in cognitive psychology.

=== MEG

Magneto-Encephalo-Graphy *detects magnetic* field changes, produced by cortical electrical activity.

Pros:

* TODO

Cons:

=== TMS

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is *blocking* electrical activity by *magnetic* fields to localize brain functions.

.TMS uses electrical coil (=Spule) to induce a magnetic field. Inhibiting neurons by repetitive pulses, activating them by single brief pulses.

=== tDCS

Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation is stimulating electrical activity, by weak *electrical currents*, to localize brain functions.

== Anatomical

=== MRI

Magnetic Resonance Imaging measures *energy changes* after magnetic field exposure.

//.xxxxx.
//image::images/neuroimaging-xxx.jpg[xxx,500,100]

Pros:

* TODO

Cons:

* Contraindicated for people with metal implants/pacemakers (use CT instead).
* Exposure of high intensity (>1 tesla) magnetic fields, which could cause a variety of undesirable issues with the data.

=== DTI

Diffusion Tension Imaging measures *diffusion of water*; imaging white matter tracts.

Pros:

* TODO

Cons:

* TODO

== Metabolic

=== PET

Positron Emission Tomography measures *glucose/oxygen* by following an injected *radioactive tracer*, also called "radioligands", a radioactive biochemical substance. When the radioactive isotope in the ligand decays, it can be measured.

//.xxxxx.
//image::images/neuroimaging-xxx.jpg[xxx,500,100]

Pros:

* TODO

Cons:

* Involves exposure to radioligands.

=== fMRI

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging measures *blood flow* changes, thus indirectly measuring metabolic activity.

.fMRI measures blood flow indicating amount of neural activity.

Pros:

* Can directly display areas of the brain that are active (compared to EEG with its low spatial resolution).

Cons:

* Can lead to people becoming claustrophic.

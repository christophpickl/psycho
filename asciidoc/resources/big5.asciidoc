= Big Five

The five-factor model of personality, or short "the big five" try to provide a valid and reliable framework of measuring and categorizing personality. It is currently the most commonly used framework in the scientific realm.

== History

We can trace back research of personality to Ancient Greece, where link:../people/hippocrates-of-kos.html[Hippocrates] came up with the binary temperaments of hot versus cold and moist versus dry, resulting in the 4 humors. Plato suggested also 4 personality types, which are: artistic (iconic), sensible (pistic), intuitive (noetic), and reasoning (dianoetic).

The case of link:../phenomena/phineas_gage.html[Phineas Gage] (after having a serious brain accident, his personality changed significantly) showed us that there is indeed a connection between the physical body (the brain) and the mental realm (the personality). Although Phrenology was debunked as pseudoscience (stating that by solely investigating the surface of the skull, one can infer deeper personality characteristics), it is indeed true that there is a direct correlation between the brain (areas) and certain aspects of a person. E.g. the activity of the Limbic system determines fear responses; and a taxi driver in London knowing the map by hard after his exam has a bigger Hippocampus.

It continued with link:../people/freud-sigmund.html[Freud] and his ego-psychology consisting of three parts: es, ich, über-ich (id, ego, super-ego). Today, we lack support for this three-part mind theory, yet it opened up insight in the unconscious realm. link:../people/jung-cg.html[Jung], one of his students which split apart later on, classified people in dichotomous variables (categorical, rather dimensional) like introverts and extroverts. He found four psychological functions: Thinking, feeling, sensation and intuition. His work had a huge impact on my theories, including the pseudo-scientific Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test.

After the wave of psychoanalysis, humanism was big. Starting with Maslow and his Hierarchy of Needs:
Physiological needs (food, water, warmth, rest), safety needs (security, safety), belonging and love needs (intimate relationships, friends), esteem needs (prestige and feelings of accomplishment) and self-actualization needs (achieving one’s full potential, self-fulfillment). link:../people/rogers-carl.html[Roger] later on contributed to that, stating that the way we try to achieve those needs stem from our personality, rather than the other way round.

link:../people/eyseneck-hans.html[Hans Eysenck] used Jung's dichotomy of introversion and extroversion, and came up with the dimensional traits of extroversion and neuroticism. He also connected body and mind more, using the example of the limbic system and the need to stimulate more (extrovert) or less (introvert), pushing personality theory into a more sophisticated area, using objective evidence rather solely philosophical musings.

link:../people/goldberg-lewis.html[Lewis Goldberg] might be the most prominent researcher in personality psychology. He improved upon link:../people/cattell-raymond.html[Raymond Cattell]'s 16 fundamental factors and used **factor analysis** to come up with 5 factors. The most outstanding aspects (next to its incredible high validity and reliability) of this theory are:

* Conceptualizing traits on a spectrum instead of as dichotomous variables;
* Contextualizing personality traits (exploring how personality shifts based on environment and time);
* Emphasizing the biological bases of personality and behavior.

== Personality

Personality makes us, us. Although, when it comes to defining it, we might start to struggle a bit, like with the consciousness: We all have some kind of fuzzy feeling of what it is, yet being precise about it, we start to have difficulties.

* "_The coherent pattern of affect, cognition, and desires (goals) as they lead to behavior._"

CAVE: Being high on a trait doesn't imply a value judgement. One is not better by scoring higher on a trait, it just indicates a personality trait. For example, being an introvert is not "worse" than being an extrovert. People are simply different.

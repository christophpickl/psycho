= Memory

Memory is divided roughly into long-term and short-term (sensory memory and working memory, where are consciousness is happening). The long-term one can be subdivided into:

. *Declarative* (explicit) memory:
.. *Episodic* memory (Events): Specific personal experiences from a particular time and place
... Autobiographical memory (Flashbulb memory)
... Experimental episodic memory
.. *Semantic* memory (Facts): World/object/language knowledge, conceptual priming
. *Non-declarative* (implicit) memory
.. Procedural memory: Skills (motor and cognitive)
.. Perceptual representation system: Perceptual priming
.. Classical conditioning: Conditioned responses between two stimuli
.. Non-associative learning: Habituation sensitization

== Introduction

== From Selfest

* Beck formulated hypothesis for psychopathology; described it in terms of schemas; used clinical observations and dream analysis. (He did not introduce the diathese-stress theory)
* Memorybias happens mostly with depression.
* Ellis stated that irational ideas are the base for neuroticism.
* Activated schemas influence information processing; contain verbal & non-verbal knowledge; modify perception; and cannot be directly observed.
* When new information is changed to fit in existing knowledge, we call this assimilation (instead of accomodation, where existing knowledge is changed so new information fits).
* Availabilityheuristic: Although we get arguments for something, we rather rely on our existing knowledge.

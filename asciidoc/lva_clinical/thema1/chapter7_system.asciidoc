* Symmetric relations can lead to escalating power struggles.
* Positive feedback processes promote change towards balance.
* Interpunctuation problems indicate disagreements of cause and effect.
* "Loose sand" families have rigid borders within family, and blurry borders to the external world.
* Criticism exists about circular causality.

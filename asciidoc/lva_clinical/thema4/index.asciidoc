== Chapter 7 - Trait theories of personality

=== Introduction

* The grounding fathers of personality psychology are:
** link:../../people/allport-gorden.html[Allport]: Cardinal/Central/Secondary traits, unscientific
** link:../../people/cattell-raymond.html[Cattell]: Surface/Source traits, 16 personality factors
** link:../../people/eyseneck-hans.html[Eyseneck]: ("Greek") Superfactors on 3 dimensions; PEN = P(sychoticism), E(xtravertedness), N(euroticism)
* Scientific functions of trait constructs: describe, predict, explain
* Criticism: Personality psychology based on traits is very "limited", as it does not explain the whole being as such and its internal mental processes (like the psychodynamic approach does)

=== Definitions of Major Concepts

* **Ability, temperament, dynamic traits**: @Cattell, Capture major aspects of personality.
* **Cardinal/Central/Secondary trait**: @Allport, ... see below ...
* **Extraversion/Introversion**: @Eyseneck, one of two dimensions of personality (sociable, friendly, impulsive, risk taking VS quiet, reserved, reflective, risk avoiding)
* **Factor analysis**: Statistical method for analzying correlations among a set of test items in order to determine those variables/test responses that increase/decrease together. Used in the development of personality tests and of some trait theories (Cattell, Eyseneck).
* **Functional autonomy**: @Allport, motive may become independent of its origins; in particular, motives in adults may become independent of their earlier base in tension reduction.
* **L/Q/OT-Data**: @Cattellk, Life-record data (everyday life behavior), Questionaires, Objective-test (observation in miniature situations)
* **Psychoticism**: @Eyseneck, Dimension of personality, solitary & insensitivity VS accept social custom & care about others
* **Neuroticism**: @Eyseneck, Dimension of personality, emotional unstability and high anxiety
* **Role**: Appropriate behavior for a person's place/status in society; limiting influence of personality variables on behavior relative to situational variables.
* **Source/Surface Trait**: @Cattell, behaviors that vary together forming independent dimension / behaviors that appear to be linked to one another but do not in fact increase/decrease together.
* **State**: @Cattell, Emotional/mood changes (anxiety, depression, fatigue) influencing bheavior; behavior is predictable by traits and states.
* **Superfactor**: @Eyseneck, A higher-order/secondary factor representing organization of traits than the initial factors derived from factor analysis.
* **Trait**: Stable (more or less) disposition to behave in a particular way, situation-dependent.

=== Allport

* Three main groups (top to down):
** Cardinal traits: Pervasive and outstanding disposition; every act is traceable to its influence; we only have few of them
** Central traits: Disposition to behave in a particular way in a range of situations.
** Secondary dispositions: Disposition to behave in a particular way that is relevant to few situations.
* Functional autonomy
** Like Freud suggested, a child has tension-reducing motives, yet Allport posits adults grow out of those
** Instead doing things solely to reduce tension/anxiety, we continue doing the same thing out of pleasure, it becomes motivation on its own (autononmous).
** Allport: "What was once extrinsic and instrumental becomes intrinsic and impelling (=treibend). The activity once served a drive or some simple need; it now serves itself or, in a larger sense, serves the self-image/-ideal of the person. Childhood is no longer in the saddle; maturity is."
* Idiographic research
** Allport focused on the uniqueness of the individual
** Others more in terms of a common, unversal (nomothetic procedures)
** He was critized for this approach, regarded as antiscientific (similar as with Freud and his detailed case studies)
** "The road to the general, to the revelatory simplicities of science, lies through a concern with the particular, the circumstantial, the concrete"

PS: link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Sade[Marquis de Sade], where sadism stems from; similar link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli[Niccolo Machiavelli], where machiavellian person stems from

=== Factor Analysis

* A purely statistical method/tool to make sense of data
* Among a big set of terms, find which are basically saying the same
** E.g. whoever smiles a lot, might also be happy a lot, meaning underneath it shares a common essence and can be reduced to a single term
* Used by Eyseneck and Cattell (not by Allport)

=== Cattell

.Raymond Cattell himself
image::../../people/cattell-raymond.jpg[Raymond Cattell,200,100]

* Two conceptual distinctions, representing different levels of analysis (introducing a hierarchy of traits)
** Surface traits: Literally visible on the surface.
** Source traits: Internal psychological structures, cause of observed surface traits.
* Result was 16 source traits grouped into three:
** Ability traits: Skills allowing us to function effectively, e.g. intelligence.
** Temperament traits: emotional life, stylistic quality of behavior. Work quickly/slowly, calm/emotional, impulsively/deliberation.
** Dynamic traits: The striving/motivational life.
* Sources of data for evidence:
** L-Data: Life record
** Q-Data: Questionnaire, self report
** OT-Data: Objective-test
* The 16 personality factors (16 P.F.) are:
[arabic]
.. reserved -- outgoing
.. less intelligent -- more intelligent
.. stable, ego strength -- emotionality/neuroticism
.. humble -- assertive
.. sober -- happy-go-lucky
.. expedient (=praktisch) -- conscientious (=pflichtbewusst)
.. shy -- venturesome
.. tough minded -- tender minded
.. trusting -- suspicious
.. practical -- imaginative
.. forthright (offen, direkt) -- shrewd (clever)
.. placid (ruhig) -- apprehensive (besorgt)
.. conservative -- experimenting
.. group dependent -- self-sufficient
.. undisciplined -- controlled
.. relaxed -- tense
** The reason his work is not so popular is simply that 16 is a too big number, thus impractical for application.
* Traits are also dependent from states and roles:
** State: The emotion/mood one is in at a given moment, determined by the situation, e.g.: anxious, depressed, fatigued, aroused, curious.
** (Social) Role: E.g. shouting at sport games and not in church, or being a teacher in school.
** "How vigorously one attacks his meal, depends not only on how hungry one happens to be, but also on ones temperament and whether one is having dinner with his employer or alone at home."

=== Eyseneck

.Hans Eyseneck himself

* Three-factor theory
* 16 traits as from Cattell were too many, he simplified it
** Was influenced by Jung and Kretschmer
** Came up with a conceptual explanation.
* Superfactors
** Like Cattell, used factor analysis but this time used it two times.
** E.g. shy and reserved are basically the same, statistically dependent
** Result: He came up with two of them, intro-/extra-verted and neurotic/stable
** Similar to the Greek (Hippocrates 400 B.C., Galen 200 A.D.) four temperamental types.
** Everyone can be located on this two-dimensional space, it is a "nomothetic system"
** Eyseneck later on added a third dimension: Psychoticism (abnormal personality: aggressive, cold, antisocial, egocentric, unempathic, creative, impersonal, impulsive, tough-minded)
*** Together these factors are referred by P(sychoticism), E(xtravertedness), N(euroticism).

== Chapter 8 - Trait theory: The five-factor model

=== Introduction

* Applications and evaluation of trait approaches to personality.
* Enormous research backing it ("proper", objective, empirical data)
* Tied to biology (from psychological to biological foundations; genetics and neurophysiology)
* Five-factor model of personality
** Also a factor-analytic trait approach (as used by Cattell and Eyseneck)
** What's new this time? Evidence! => Using natural language and cross-culutural research
* Cross-cultural research / are the big 5 universal?
** Language is always slightly different, e.g. "aggressive", german = hostile, english = forceful-assertive
** Some traits are more stable (CEA) across cultures, some less
** "Chinese tradition factor"? needs more research/evidence
* Even animals show consistent expression of emotions (thus also have traits; not only antropomorphism)
* It tells us about certain test scores, but gives us little understanding about the "how" and the "why"

=== Definitions

* **Big Five**: Short version for the five-factor model, five broad bipolar dimensions of personality
* **Facets**: More specific components (traits) which make up the Big Five factors (e.g. extraversion: activity level, assertiveness, warmth, etc.)
* **Five-factor theory**: big five are more than just descriptions => things that really exist; psychological structure (like we have a certain degree of height)
* **Fundamental Lexical Hypothesis**: Over time, most important individual differences in human interaction, are encoded in single terms into language.
** According to Goldberg: "the most important individual differences in human transactions will come to be encoded as single terms in some or all of the world's langauges"
* **NEO-PI-R**: Personality questionnaire, designed to measure on the Big Five (and facets).
* **OCEAN**: Acronym for: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism.
* **Person-Situation controversy**: Controversy between consistency VS variability of behavior relating to a particular situation.

=== Big Five

* Openness
** High score: curious, broad interests, creative, original, imaginative, untraditional
** Low score: conventional, down-to-earth, narrow interests, unartistic, unanalytical
** Trait scales: assesses proactive seeking and appreciation of experience for its own sake; toleration for and exploration of the unfamiliar
* Conscientiousness
** High score: organized, reliable, hard-working, self-disciplined, punctual, scrupulous, neat, ambitious, persevering (=ausdauernd)
** Low score: aaimless, unreliable, lazy, careless, lax, negligent (=fahrlässig), weak-willed, hedonistic
** Trait scales: assesses the individual's degree of organization, persistence and motivation in goal-directed behavior; contrasts dependable, fastidious (=anspruchsvoll) people with those who are lackadaisical (=nachlässig) and sloppy
* Extraversion
** High score: sociable, active, talkative, person-oriented, optimistic, fun-loving, affectionate
** Low score: reserved, sober, unexuberant (=unüberschwänglich), aloof (=distanziert), task-oriented, retiring, quiet
** Trait scales: assesses quantity and intensity of interpersonal interaction; activity level; need for stimulation; capacity for joy
* Agreeableness
** High score: soft-hearted, good-natured, trusting, helpful, forgiving, gullible (=leichtgläubig), straightforward
** Low score: cynical, rude, suspicious, uncooperative, vengeful, ruthless, irritable, manipulative
** Trait scales: assesses the quality of one's interpersonal orientation along a continuum from compassion to antagonism in thoughts, feelings and actions
* Neuroticism
** High score: worrying, nervous, emotional, insecure, inadequate, hypochondriacal
** Low score: calm, relaxed, unemotional, hardy (=zaeh), secure, self-satisfied
** Trait scales: asseses adjustment versus emotional instability; identifies individuals prone to psychological distress, unrealistic ideas, excessive cravings or urges, maladaptive coping responses

=== NEO-PI-R

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory
* Questionnaire tailored for the big five
* NEO (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness) Personality Inventory, Revised
** Later added CA (Conscientiousness, Agreeableness) as well
* Each factor differentiated into 6 facets; Each facet measured by 8 items
** 240 question items = 5 factors * 6 facets * 8 items
* Can be self- (S-data) and observer-report data (O-data)

==== Facets

* Openness: fantasy, aesthetics, feelings, ideas, actions, values
* Conscientiousness: self-discipline, dutifulness, competence, order, deliberation, achievement striving (spock from star trek)
* Extraversion: gregariousness, activity level, assertiveness, excitement seeking, positive emotions, warmth (bill clintion)
* Agreeableness: straightforwardness, trust, altruism, modesty, tendermindedness, compliance
* Neuroticism: anxiety, self-consciousness, depression, vulnerability, impulsiveness, angry hostility (woody allen)

=== Age differences

* We have a certain set-point, yet changes over time a bit, and lot potential (within given range)
* The older: -NEO and +AC
* Teenagers have ("angry young man"):
** +O = willing for experimentation
** -C = less responsible to others
** -A = more critical and demanding
** +E = more phone/social activities
** +N = anxieties/concerns acceptance and self-esteem
* This contradicts five-factory theorie's brand of biologism
** Not totally inherited (constant), but affected by social experiences
* Children's personality seem more complex (less integrated): 7 instead of 5 factors (sociability/activity, fearful/irritability)
** They merge together to form a broader; more fully integrated dimensions
* Insights about personality/trait stability:
[arabic]
.. Personality more stable over short period (than over long)
.. More stable in adulthood (than in childhood)
.. Individual differences during development
.. Determined limits of environmental influence on change
.. Reasons for stability are genetic and environmental. Change happens also because of life circumstances and active efforts (psychotherapy).

=== More Factors?!

* Sixth trait coming up: honesty/humility (e.g. Mother Teresa)
** Low: honest, sincere, loyal/faithful, frank, truthful, true/genuine, veracious (=wahrhaftig), just, helpful, unselfish
** High: mean, arrogant, egoistic, thoughtless, disloyal, pretending, flattering, smug (=selbstgefällig), haughty (=hochmütig), boastful (=prahlerisch), megalomaniac (=größenwahnsinnige), cunning (=gerissen)
* If changing from only analyzing adjectives to nouns and verbs as well, we end up with even 8 factors

=== Applications

* For: employers, educators, clinicians, ... reliable means for assessement.
* Usecase: Predict future suitable occupation (performance in it).
** High E: social, enterprising
** High O: journalist/freelance writer (requiring curiosity, creativity, independent thinking)
* Subjective well-being: High C means, take better care of themselves, live longer
* Clinicians, for diagnose/prognosis/treatment:
** E.g. compulsive personality has high CN; antisocial low AC
** "Some people need to lie on a couch and talk about their mother. My therapy is working out at the gym."
** High O: dream interpretation in psychoanalysis, or self-actualization of humanistic-existential approach.
* Yet, there is no such thing as "trait theory therapy"

=== Person-Situation controversy

* Trait is supposed to influence behavior *consistently*; how consistent is it though?!
** Big criticism towards Big Five
** Reason why it fails to predict behavior
* In different situations (opportunities, constraints, rules, norms) we act differently
* Differentiate:
[arabic]
.. Longitudinal stability: High on a trait one time and another time (more stable)
.. Cross-situational consistency: High on a trait in some situations and also other situations (questionable)
* E.g.: aggressiveness in church; agreeableness in football game
* Approach to solve: Ask in different contexts, and aggregate measurements
** Not working really well; e.g. student conscientious taking notes in lecture but very messy dorm room
** Yet consistency is not equals zero, there is at least some consistency!

=== Evaluation

* The database
** Careful scientific observations -check
** Objective -check (and also very diverse; different ages, ethnicities, sociocultural backgrounds)
** More than self-reports
* Systematic
** Analyzing traits and also states, roles, motiviational processes
** Although contemporary trait theories are less systematic
* Testability
** Can be tested empirically and objectively -check
* Comprehensive
** Remarkably comprehensive -check (in some respects)
** All significant individual differences incorporated in the taxonomy (factor-analytic studiy of personality structure)
** Not comprehensive due to... un/conscious processes, sexuality, dreams, parent/child or therapist/patient relationship
*** No statement about these things. Simply not addressed.
** How about physical factors like: Attractiveness, athelticism, healthiness
** Maybe Big Five where never intended to be that comprehensive?!

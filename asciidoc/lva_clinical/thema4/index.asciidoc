== Chapter 7 - Trait theories of personality

=== Introduction

* The grounding fathers of personality psychology are:
** link:../../people/allport-gorden.html[Allport]: Cardinal/Central/Secondary traits, unscientific
** link:../../people/cattell-raymond.html[Cattell]: Surface/Source traits, 16 personality factors
** link:../../people/eyseneck-hans.html[Eyseneck]: ("Greek") Superfactors on 3 dimensions; PEN = P(sychoticism), E(xtravertedness), N(euroticism)
* Scientific functions of trait constructs: describe, predict, explain
* Criticism: Personality psychology based on traits is very "limited", as it does not explain the whole being as such and its internal mental processes (like the psychodynamic approach does)

=== Definitions of Major Concepts

* **Ability, temperament, dynamic traits**: @Cattell, Capture major aspects of personality.
* **Cardinal/Central/Secondary trait**: @Allport, ... see below ...
* **Extraversion/Introversion**: @Eyseneck, one of two dimensions of personality (sociable, friendly, impulsive, risk taking VS quiet, reserved, reflective, risk avoiding)
* **Factor analysis**: Statistical method for analzying correlations among a set of test items in order to determine those variables/test responses that increase/decrease together. Used in the development of personality tests and of some trait theories (Cattell, Eyseneck).
* **Functional autonomy**: @Allport, motive may become independent of its origins; in particular, motives in adults may become independent of their earlier base in tension reduction.
* **L/Q/OT-Data**: @Cattellk, Life-record data (everyday life behavior), Questionaires, Objective-test (observation in miniature situations)
* **Psychoticism**: @Eyseneck, Dimension of personality, solitary & insensitivity VS accept social custom & care about others
* **Neuroticism**: @Eyseneck, Dimension of personality, emotional unstability and high anxiety
* **Role**: Appropriate behavior for a person's place/status in society; limiting influence of personality variables on behavior relative to situational variables.
* **Source/Surface Trait**: @Cattell, behaviors that vary together forming independent dimension / behaviors that appear to be linked to one another but do not in fact increase/decrease together.
* **State**: @Cattell, Emotional/mood changes (anxiety, depression, fatigue) influencing bheavior; behavior is predictable by traits and states.
* **Superfactor**: @Eyseneck, A higher-order/secondary factor representing organization of traits than the initial factors derived from factor analysis.
* **Trait**: Stable (more or less) disposition to behave in a particular way, situation-dependent.

=== Allport

.Gorden Allport himself

* Three main groups (top to down):
** Cardinal traits: Pervasive and outstanding disposition; every act is traceable to its influence; we only have few of them
** Central traits: Disposition to behave in a particular way in a range of situations.
** Secondary dispositions: Disposition to behave in a particular way that is relevant to few situations.
* Functional autonomy
** Like Freud suggested, a child has tension-reducing motives, yet Allport posits adults grow out of those
** Instead doing things solely to reduce tension/anxiety, we continue doing the same thing out of pleasure, it becomes motivation on its own (autononmous).
** Allport: "What was once extrinsic and instrumental becomes intrinsic and impelling (=treibend). The activity once served a drive or some simple need; it now serves itself or, in a larger sense, serves the self-image/-ideal of the person. Childhood is no longer in the saddle; maturity is."
* Idiographic research
** Allport focused on the uniqueness of the individual
** Others more in terms of a common, unversal (nomothetic procedures)
** He was critized for this approach, regarded as antiscientific (similar as with Freud and his detailed case studies)
** "The road to the general, to the revelatory simplicities of science, lies through a concern with the particular, the circumstantial, the concrete"

PS: link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Sade[Marquis de Sade], where sadism stems from; similar link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli[Niccolo Machiavelli], where machiavellian person stems from

=== Factor Analysis

* A purely statistical method/tool to make sense of data
* Among a big set of terms, find which are basically saying the same
** E.g. whoever smiles a lot, might also be happy a lot, meaning underneath it shares a common essence and can be reduced to a single term
* Used by Eyseneck and Cattell (not by Allport)

=== Cattell

.Raymond Cattell himself
image::../../people/cattell-raymond.jpg[Raymond Cattell,200,100]

* Two conceptual distinctions, representing different levels of analysis (introducing a hierarchy of traits)
** Surface traits: Literally visible on the surface.
** Source traits: Internal psychological structures, cause of observed surface traits.
* Result was 16 source traits grouped into three:
** Ability traits: Skills allowing us to function effectively, e.g. intelligence.
** Temperament traits: emotional life, stylistic quality of behavior. Work quickly/slowly, calm/emotional, impulsively/deliberation.
** Dynamic traits: The striving/motivational life.
* Sources of data for evidence:
** L-Data: Life record
** Q-Data: Questionnaire, self report
** OT-Data: Objective-test
* The 16 personality factors (16 P.F.) are:
[arabic]
.. reserved -- outgoing
.. less intelligent -- more intelligent
.. stable, ego strength -- emotionality/neuroticism
.. humble -- assertive
.. sober -- happy-go-lucky
.. expedient (=praktisch) -- conscientious (=pflichtbewusst)
.. shy -- venturesome
.. tough minded -- tender minded
.. trusting -- suspicious
.. practical -- imaginative
.. forthright (offen, direkt) -- shrewd (clever)
.. placid (ruhig) -- apprehensive (besorgt)
.. conservative -- experimenting
.. group dependent -- self-sufficient
.. undisciplined -- controlled
.. relaxed -- tense
** The reason his work is not so popular is simply that 16 is a too big number, thus impractical for application.
* Traits are also dependent from states and roles:
** State: The emotion/mood one is in at a given moment, determined by the situation, e.g.: anxious, depressed, fatigued, aroused, curious.
** (Social) Role: E.g. shouting at sport games and not in church, or being a teacher in school.
** "How vigorously one attacks his meal, depends not only on how hungry one happens to be, but also on ones temperament and whether one is having dinner with his employer or alone at home."

=== Eyseneck

.Hans Eyseneck himself
image::../../people/eyseneck-hans.png[Hans Eyseneck,200,100]

* Three-factor theory
* 16 traits as from Cattell were too many, he simplified it
** Was influenced by Jung and Kretschmer
** Came up with a conceptual explanation.
* Superfactors
** Like Cattell, used factor analysis but this time used it two times.
** E.g. shy and reserved are basically the same, statistically dependent
** Result: He came up with two of them, intro-/extra-verted and neurotic/stable
** Similar to the Greek (Hippocrates 400 B.C., Galen 200 A.D.) four temperamental types.
** Everyone can be located on this two-dimensional space, it is a "nomothetic system"
** Eyseneck later on added a third dimension: Psychoticism (abnormal personality: aggressive, cold, antisocial, egocentric, unempathic, creative, impersonal, impulsive, tough-minded)
*** Together these factors are referred by P(sychoticism), E(xtravertedness), N(euroticism).

== Chapter 8 - Trait theory: The five-factor model

=== Introduction

* Applications and evaluation of trait approaches to personality.
* Enormous research backing it ("proper", objective, empirical data)
* Tied to biology (from psychological to biological foundations; genetics and neurophysiology)
* Five-factor model of personality
** Also a factor-analytic trait approach (as used by Cattell and Eyseneck)
** What's new this time? Evidence! => Using natural language and cross-culutural research
* Cross-cultural research / are the big 5 universal?
** Language is always slightly different, e.g. "aggressive", german = hostile, english = forceful-assertive
** Some traits are more stable (CEA) across cultures, some less
** "Chinese tradition factor"? needs more research/evidence
* Even animals show consistent expression of emotions (thus also have traits; not only antropomorphism)
* It tells us about certain test scores, but gives us little understanding about the "how" and the "why"

=== Definitions

* **Big Five**: Short version for the five-factor model, five broad bipolar dimensions of personality
* **Facets**: More specific components (traits) which make up the Big Five factors (e.g. extraversion: activity level, assertiveness, warmth, etc.)
* **Five-factor theory**: big five are more than just descriptions => things that really exist; psychological structure (like we have a certain degree of height)
* **Fundamental Lexical Hypothesis**: Over time, most important individual differences in human interaction, are encoded in single terms into language.
** According to Goldberg: "the most important individual differences in human transactions will come to be encoded as single terms in some or all of the world's langauges"
* **NEO-PI-R**: Personality questionnaire, designed to measure on the Big Five (and facets).
* **OCEAN**: Acronym for: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism.
* **Person-Situation controversy**: Controversy between consistency VS variability of behavior relating to a particular situation.

=== Big Five

* Openness
** High score: curious, broad interests, creative, original, imaginative, untraditional
** Low score: conventional, down-to-earth, narrow interests, unartistic, unanalytical
** Trait scales: assesses proactive seeking and appreciation of experience for its own sake; toleration for and exploration of the unfamiliar
* Conscientiousness
** High score: organized, reliable, hard-working, self-disciplined, punctual, scrupulous, neat, ambitious, persevering (=ausdauernd)
** Low score: aaimless, unreliable, lazy, careless, lax, negligent (=fahrlässig), weak-willed, hedonistic
** Trait scales: assesses the individual's degree of organization, persistence and motivation in goal-directed behavior; contrasts dependable, fastidious (=anspruchsvoll) people with those who are lackadaisical (=nachlässig) and sloppy
* Extraversion
** High score: sociable, active, talkative, person-oriented, optimistic, fun-loving, affectionate
** Low score: reserved, sober, unexuberant (=unüberschwänglich), aloof (=distanziert), task-oriented, retiring, quiet
** Trait scales: assesses quantity and intensity of interpersonal interaction; activity level; need for stimulation; capacity for joy
* Agreeableness
** High score: soft-hearted, good-natured, trusting, helpful, forgiving, gullible (=leichtgläubig), straightforward
** Low score: cynical, rude, suspicious, uncooperative, vengeful, ruthless, irritable, manipulative
** Trait scales: assesses the quality of one's interpersonal orientation along a continuum from compassion to antagonism in thoughts, feelings and actions
* Neuroticism
** High score: worrying, nervous, emotional, insecure, inadequate, hypochondriacal
** Low score: calm, relaxed, unemotional, hardy (=zaeh), secure, self-satisfied
** Trait scales: asseses adjustment versus emotional instability; identifies individuals prone to psychological distress, unrealistic ideas, excessive cravings or urges, maladaptive coping responses

=== NEO-PI-R

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory
* Questionnaire tailored for the big five
* NEO (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness) Personality Inventory, Revised
** Later added CA (Conscientiousness, Agreeableness) as well
* Each factor differentiated into 6 facets; Each facet measured by 8 items
** 240 question items = 5 factors * 6 facets * 8 items
* Can be self- (S-data) and observer-report data (O-data)

==== Facets

* Openness: fantasy, aesthetics, feelings, ideas, actions, values
* Conscientiousness: self-discipline, dutifulness, competence, order, deliberation, achievement striving (spock from star trek)
* Extraversion: gregariousness, activity level, assertiveness, excitement seeking, positive emotions, warmth (bill clintion)
* Agreeableness: straightforwardness, trust, altruism, modesty, tendermindedness, compliance
* Neuroticism: anxiety, self-consciousness, depression, vulnerability, impulsiveness, angry hostility (woody allen)

=== Age differences

* We have a certain set-point, yet changes over time a bit, and lot potential (within given range)
* The older: -NEO and +AC
* Teenagers have ("angry young man"):
** +O = willing for experimentation
** -C = less responsible to others
** -A = more critical and demanding
** +E = more phone/social activities
** +N = anxieties/concerns acceptance and self-esteem
* This contradicts five-factory theorie's brand of biologism
** Not totally inherited (constant), but affected by social experiences
* Children's personality seem more complex (less integrated): 7 instead of 5 factors (sociability/activity, fearful/irritability)
** They merge together to form a broader; more fully integrated dimensions
* Insights about personality/trait stability:
[arabic]
.. Personality more stable over short period (than over long)
.. More stable in adulthood (than in childhood)
.. Individual differences during development
.. Determined limits of environmental influence on change
.. Reasons for stability are genetic and environmental. Change happens also because of life circumstances and active efforts (psychotherapy).

=== More Factors?!

* Sixth trait coming up: honesty/humility (e.g. Mother Teresa)
** Low: honest, sincere, loyal/faithful, frank, truthful, true/genuine, veracious (=wahrhaftig), just, helpful, unselfish
** High: mean, arrogant, egoistic, thoughtless, disloyal, pretending, flattering, smug (=selbstgefällig), haughty (=hochmütig), boastful (=prahlerisch), megalomaniac (=größenwahnsinnige), cunning (=gerissen)
* If changing from only analyzing adjectives to nouns and verbs as well, we end up with even 8 factors

=== Applications

* For: employers, educators, clinicians, ... reliable means for assessement.
* Usecase: Predict future suitable occupation (performance in it).
** High E: social, enterprising
** High O: journalist/freelance writer (requiring curiosity, creativity, independent thinking)
* Subjective well-being: High C means, take better care of themselves, live longer
* Clinicians, for diagnose/prognosis/treatment:
** E.g. compulsive personality has high CN; antisocial low AC
** "Some people need to lie on a couch and talk about their mother. My therapy is working out at the gym."
** High O: dream interpretation in psychoanalysis, or self-actualization of humanistic-existential approach.
* Yet, there is no such thing as "trait theory therapy"

=== Person-Situation controversy

* Trait is supposed to influence behavior *consistently*; how consistent is it though?!
** Big criticism towards Big Five
** Reason why it fails to predict behavior
* In different situations (opportunities, constraints, rules, norms) we act differently
* Differentiate:
[arabic]
.. Longitudinal stability: High on a trait one time and another time (more stable)
.. Cross-situational consistency: High on a trait in some situations and also other situations (questionable)
* E.g.: aggressiveness in church; agreeableness in football game
* Approach to solve: Ask in different contexts, and aggregate measurements
** Not working really well; e.g. student conscientious taking notes in lecture but very messy dorm room
** Yet consistency is not equals zero, there is at least some consistency!

=== Evaluation

* The database
** Careful scientific observations -check
** Objective -check (and also very diverse; different ages, ethnicities, sociocultural backgrounds)
** More than self-reports
* Systematic
** Analyzing traits and also states, roles, motiviational processes
** Although contemporary trait theories are less systematic
* Testability
** Can be tested empirically and objectively -check
* Comprehensive
** Remarkably comprehensive -check (in some respects)
** All significant individual differences incorporated in the taxonomy (factor-analytic studiy of personality structure)
** Not comprehensive due to... un/conscious processes, sexuality, dreams, parent/child or therapist/patient relationship
*** No statement about these things. Simply not addressed.
** How about physical factors like: Attractiveness, athelticism, healthiness
** Maybe Big Five where never intended to be that comprehensive?!

== Chapter 9 - Biological foundations of personality

=== Introduction

* link:../../people/galton-francis.html[Sir Francis Galton] coined and started the discussion of: "nature VS nurture"
* Evolution = Shaping of personality by processes from our ancestral past
* Temperament = biologically based individual differences evident early in life
** Longitudinal studies, objective measures (behavior/consitutional-biological variables)
** Kagan's research on un-/inhibited children
* Evolutionary theory
** Ultimate cause of behavior (why evolved, adaptive function it serves)
** Sex differences in mate preferences/jealousy/parental investment/parenthood probability.
* Establish genetic-behavior relationships via:
** 1) selective breeding 2) twin studies 3) adoption studies
** Significant heritability of intelligence and most personality charactersitic (about 50% variance in personality due to genetics)
* Neuroscientifically...
** Neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin
** Differences in hemispheric lateralization
** Amygdala and processing emotional stimuli/emotional memories
** 3D temperament model (Clark and Watson) systemazing relation neuroscience and personality.
** fMRI helped to identify brain arease for things like judgement about self/morality of actions (cognitive higher-level functions)
* Plasticity: Potential to change in neurobiological systems (as a result of experience)
** Not only genetics, but also environment plays a role for personality
* Sometimes scientific advances happen due to accidents, Newton's apple or the case of link:../../phenomena/phineas_gage.html[Phineas Gage]
** Gage's story shows us the interconnections between brain and personality functioning.

=== Definitions

* **Adoption studies** (also see Twin studies): Establish genetic-behavior relationships, by comparing biological siblings reared together VS apart.
* **Behavioral genetics**: Study of genetic contributions to behaviors, by comparing similarity among individuals of varying degrees of biological-genetic similarity.
* **Effortful control**: Capacity to control one's actions by stopping one activity (dominant response) in order to do another; a quality of temperament.
* **Evolved psychological mechanisms** (evolutionary psychology): Mechanisms resulted out of evolution by selection (adaptive for survival/reproduction).
* **fMRI** (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging): Brain-imaging technique; recording changes of blood flow (thus implied more neuronal activity, as needs more "fuel").
* **Heritability**: Proporation of variance in scores, specific population, attributed to genetic factors.
* **Inhibited-uninhibited temperaments**: Inhibited child reacts to unfamiliar persons/events with restraint/avoidance/distress, takes longer to relax, more unusual fears/phobias. Uninhibited child enjoy these things, responding with spontaneity/laughter/smiles easily.
* **nature VS nurture**: heredity, genetic, biology VS environment, learned, social (by link:../../people/galton-francis.html[Sir Francis Galton])
* **Neurotransmitters**: Chemical substances, transmitting information among neurons (e.g. dopamine, serotonine).
* **Parental investment theory**: Women have greater investment in offspring than men (fewer genes passed on).
* **Phrenology**: Early 19th century attempt, location of brain arease responsible for emotions/behavior; developed by Gall; discredited as quackery/superstition.
* **Plasticity**: Ability to change (of neurobiological systems), within limits of genes, to meet current adaptive demands and as a result of experience.
* **Proximate causes**: Explanations for behavior associated with current biological processes in the organism.
* **Selective breeding**: Establish genetic-behavior relationships, by breeindg particular characteristics.
* **Non-/Shared environments**: Comparison in behavioral genetics research, effects of siblings growing up in same/different environment.
* **3D temperament model**: Three superfactors as temperaments: PE (Positive Emotion), NE (Negative Emotion) and DvC (Disinhibition versus Constraint).
* **Twin studies** (also see Adoption studies): Establish genetic-behavior relationships, by comparing identical/fraternal/nontwin siblings.

=== Temperament

* Definition: Biologically based individual differences in emotional&motivational tendencies (evident early in life)
* Children are already showing signs of (different) temperaments; variation in styles of emotion and behavior
** Their world experiences are so limited, thus it cannot be product of social experience; it must be biological
** E.g. experiencing positive/negative moods, aroused in response to stimuli, or calm oneself down after being upset

==== Early view

* Greece:
** Hippocrates posited his theory on the four bodily fluids (blood, black bile, yellow bile, phlegm)
** Reflecting beliefs about the universe, which consists of nothing but: air, earth, fire water
** Thus four temperaments: sanguine (cheerful, optimistic), melancholic (loyal, calm, orderly), choleric (practical, analytical, tough), phlegmatic (intuitive, agreeable, warm)
** Lasted for two millenia! Even Immanuel Kant based on this.
* Gall's phrenology: Idea that shape of skull leads to indications of brain functions
* Three critical publications:
[arabic]
... "The Origin of Species" (1859, Charles Darwin), science of biology
... "The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals" (1872, Charles Darwin), study of temperament, and base of evolutionary psychology
... "Experiments on Plant Hybrids" (1865, Gregor Mendel); breeding, base of genetics

==== Longitudinal Studies

* Longitudinal studies observe people over an extended period of time; something which was missing for studying temperaments a long time.
* Question is: Are these psychological qualities evident in early life and enduring
* Infant characteristics measured like: activity level, general mood, attentions pan, persistence.
* Three types of babies:
[arabic]
.. easy: playful, adaptable
.. difficult: negative, unadaptable
.. slow-to-warm-up: low in reactivity, mild responses
* Also used parental ratings of children based on dimensions like: emotionality, activity and sociability
* Studies found result: There is a link between early temperament and later personality characteristics

==== Un/inhibited Children

* Research (by Kagan et al) about biological bases of temperament
** Direct observation of children's behavior in a lab setting
* Result are two types of children's temperaments: *Uninhibited and inhibited* children
** Inhibited children react to unfamiliar persons/events with restraint/avoidance/distress, takes longer to relax, more unusual fears/phobias.
** Uninhibited children enjoy these things, responding with spontaneity/laughter/smiles easily.
* Those types are pretty stable over the years (=consistent over time)
** Yet again: Enviornment plays a considerable role, allowing people's temperemant to change
** Kagan says: "Any predisposition conferred by our genetic endowment is far from being a life sentence; there is no inevitable adult outcome of a particular infant temperament" yet "it is very difficult to change one's inherited predisposition completely"
* Neuroimaging shows: amygdala involved (fear response) and frontal cortex (emotional regulation)
** Social experiences can modify brain functioning
** Confirmed by fMRI scans of adults (before grouped as strong un/inhibited children), showing familiar/novel faces; amygdala reactivity differs
* On molecular basis (at least for mice), a protein called "stathmin" could be found, influencing amygdala's functioning
** Yet: Don't overinterpret the influence of biological foundations of personality!
** The amygdala has many different responsibilities then fear response, and also is the only biological mechanism in fear response.
** People with amygdala damage do not differ in their fear response
** It may have more to do with novelty than fear: "a state of surprise is a more reliable incentive for amygdalar activation than a state of fear" (Kagan)

==== Effortful Control

* How to influence/regulate emotions/actions?
* Effortful control: stop one thing in order to do another
** Or: "The ability to suppress a dominant response in order to perform a subdominant response"
** E.g.: Stop watching TV to study; stop eating sweets to lose bodyfat.
* Interesting in regards to moral conscience (called "superego" by link:../../people/freud-sigmund.html[Freud])
** Capacity to adhere to social norms by internalizing moral/ethical standards of behavior
* Approaches:
[arabic]
.. Freud focused on child's experience with parents
.. Examine differences in inherited biology
.. Inherited biology _and_ parental influence (what has been done here)
* Examine relations among: 1) effortful control 2) development of conscience 3) mothers authority assertion
** The more authoritive, the less the child internalizes rules of proper social conduct (failing self-control skills)
** Famous "snack delay" experiment, where a child learns delayed gratification by self-control

=== Genes

* 23 pairs of chromosomes, each pair from each parent
** Each chromosome has thousands genes
** Genes made up of DNA molecules; direct protein synthesis
* Genes don't govern behavior directly!
** There is no "introversion gene", but they impact proteins/hormones that will influence behavior indirectly

==== Behavioral Genetics

* ... is the study of genetic contributions to behavior
* Three primary research methods/studies: selective breeding, twin, adoption
[arabic]
.. Selective Breeding Studies
*** Desired trait can be selected by a selection/reproduction process with successive generations
*** E.g. breed barking/fearful dogs; also used outside research (race horses, dogs with certain characteristics)
*** Helps to understand genetical difference VS different environmental rearing conditions
*** Instead of blaming it to the individual person (e.g. alcohol addiction) we can see the role of genes
.. Twin Studies
*** As we don't want to do selective breeding studies with humans, twins help out a lot
*** Identical twins (monozygotic; MZ) develop from same fertilized egg VS fraternal twins (dizygotic; DZ) genetically similar as any sibling (50%)
*** As (identical) twins are genetically identical, the only difference is the environment
*** Also when they (fraternal twins, regular siblings) share the same environment, but have different genes
*** Interestingly, although MZs reared apart, and meet in later adulthood, they show same personalities
.. Adoption Studies
*** Same environment, different genes (or same if identical twins)
*** Interesting to compare with biological/adoptive parents
*** Also nice to include biological and adoptive children
*** Finding: The more genetically similar, to more similar the IQ (high correlation): Strong genetic contribution to intelligence
* **Heratibility Coefficient**
** Also called "h2" (squared, as the numbers are squared when computing variations around an average score)
** Representing proportion of observed variance in scores, attributed to genetics
** If MZ twins are not any more similar than DZ, then there is no genetic effect: h2 is zero
*** If MZ differs greatly from DZ, then h2 is large (upper limit is 1.0, or 100%)
** When the h2 is lower, then there are other factors than genetics at play (environmental)
** Note: h2 refers to the population examined in a given study; it does not indicate how genetics influence individual characteristics
* Heratibility of Personality
** Two key quotes summarizes it (mostly from twin/adoption studies):
[arabic]
... "It is difficult to find psychological traits that reliably show no genetic influence"
... "For almost every behavioral trait so far investigated, from reaction time to religiosity, an important fraction of the variation among people turns out to be associated with genetic variation. This fact need no longer be subject to debate"
** Identical twins, reared apart, sometimes not only look and sound alike, but also share same attitudes, hobbies and preferences for pets.
** Criticism: Studies are mostly based on self-report questionnaire methods
** Warning: Heritability estimate is a population statistic; variation between people in the overall population (not speaking about a single individual)
** Although there is an inherited component in personality traits, they still can change (through environmental experiences)
*** E.g. height is significantly determined by genes, but can be influenced by nutrition in childhood
* Molecular genetic paradigms
** The behavior-genetic paradigm is outdated today, nowadays we look more at the underlying biology
** Identify specific genes, how linked to personality traits; show genetic variations/alleles
** E.g. a gene that coes for an enzyme that lowers neurotransmitters that are linked to aggressive behavior (similar with depression)

==== Environments

* Genetic and environmental influences extremely linked
** See "Maze-bright/dull rats experiment" using selective breeding and putting them in different environments
** 40-50% variance for single personality characteristics and personality overall, determined by genetic factors
*** Rest of the population variance = environmental effects and measurement errors
*** "Genetic influence is so ubiquitous and pervasive in behavior, that a shift in emphasis is warranted: ask not what is heritable; ask instead what is not heritable" yet at the same time "other message is, that the same behavioral genetic data yield the strongest available evidence for the importance of environmental influence"
* Non-/shared environments
** Again the good old "nature / nurture" debate (of behavioral genetics)
** Shared env.: environmental influences making siblings more alike (same experiences, same family)
** Nonshared env.: creating differences among siblings who grow up in the same family (treated differently by parents)
** Finding: Shared env. effects has only little impact on personality; nonshared are large though
** Interestingly, parenting unique to each child, due to genetic characterists of that child
*** The child evokes different behavior in the parent
* Nature-nurture interactions
** "The critical point to remember in all of this is, that in the dance of life, genes and environment are absolutely inextricable (=untrennbar) partners"
** Three kinds of interactions:
[arabic]
... Same enviromental experiences, different effects on individuals with different genes
... Individuals with different genes, evoke different responses from the environment
... Individuals with different genes, select and create different environments

=== Mood, Emotion, Brain

==== Hemispheres

* Brain has two halves, left/right hemispheric
* *Hemispheric dominance in emotion*
** Left = positive; Right = negative emotions (EEG finding by showing emotion evoking film clips)
** Decreased left-anterior cortical activity = depressed individuals; Right-anterior brain damage = maniac
** But, not so much a judged (good/bad), but rather whether to approach or avoid: when happy, you approach to interact; when angrey, you approach to confront
* PS: Cause of behavior might be encoded in genes, and acquired from experience later on, but what about prenatal experiences?!
** For example sexual orientation: Once you a younger brother has older brothers, you are more likely to be homosexual (a probabilistic statement!)
** Does not apply to female, and does not have to do with postnatal experiences (reared up together)
** Why? The mother develops some immune response to a substance important to male fetus development (Maternal Immune Hypothesis)

==== Neurotransmitter

* Neurotransmitters like: Dopamine and serotonine
** Has to do with individual differences in mood
** Dopamine: reward system, pleasure, feel good chemical; "that was good, let's do it again and let's remember exactly how we did it"
*** Cocaine "masquerades" as dopamine, leading to pleasure when taking the drug (and also the "drop" when stop taking the drug)
** Too much dopamine => schizophrenia; too little dopamine => Parkinson's disease
** SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; prozac): so serotonin stays longer in synaptic cleft and has longer effect
*** Serotonoin is responsible for mood, thus alleviates depression
*** When given to "normal" people: reduce nedgative affective experience; increase social/affiliative behavior
*** Used to treat depression, phobias, OCD (not exactly known how they work)
** Also cortisol is associated with stress response
* Three dimensions (superfactors) of temperament: PE (Positive Emotion), NE (Negative Emotion), DvC (Disinhibition versus Constraint)
** NE:
*** high = threatened, problematic, distressed
*** low = calm, emotionally stable, self-satisfied
** PE (dopamine = thrill seeking, impulsivity, disinhibition):
*** high = engage, social, active life, energetic, cheerful, enthusiastic
*** low = (like introverts) reserved, socially aloof, low energy/confidence
** Although PE&NE seem opposite-sounding, we can have both high/low at the same time (controlled by different internal biological systems)
** DvC (serotonin, testosterone): style of affective regulation
*** high = impulsive, reckless
*** low = careful, controlled, risk avoiding
** low serotonin = more aggressive; need more dopamine-activating drugs (alcohol)
*** Serotonin, the "feel bad" chemical
** Also left/right hemispheric lateralization plays a role
** Also (excessive sensitivity of) amygdala plays a role (experiencing anxiety/distress)
** There is no 1-to-1 correlation between biological porcesses and personality traits!
* Brain is not one big unit, but consists of several subsystems ("suborgans").
** link:../../people/damasio-antonio.html[Damasio] says: "I am not falling into the phrenological trap. To put it simply: The mind results from the operation of each of the separate components, and from the concerted operation of the multiple systems constituted by those separate systems."

Links biology and personality:
* **Amygdala**: Part of primitiv limbic system; emotional response center; aversive emotional learning.
* **Hemispheric Lateralization**: right frontal = negative emotions, shyness, inhibition; left = positive emotions, boldness, disinhibition.
* **Dopamine**: Neurotransmitter; reward, reinforcement, pleasure. High = positive emotions, energetic, disinhibition, impulsivity. Low = lethargy, anxiety, constriction.
* **Serotonin**: Neurotransmitter; mood, irritability, impulsivity. Low = depression, violence, impulsivity. See SSRIs.
* **Cortisol**: Hormone; stress-realted, facilitates threat-reaction; secreted by adrenal cortex; adaptive for short-term stress, chronic stress leads to depression/memory loss.
* **Testosterone**: Hormone; secondary sex characteristic development; dominance, competitiveness, aggression.

=== Plasticity

* Only partly true that 1) biology is fixed; genes and 2) biology is the cuase for psychological experiences
** Biology can change, as a result of behavioral experience.
** Like plastic, biology can be shaped and molded => plasticity
* Neural systems & neurotransmitters are "plastic"
** Bidirectional: When high-ranked monkey is put down, his serotonin levels drop, new leaders increase.
** Even when winning coin tossing game, testosterone levels increase!
** "Winneres get a blast of testosterone; losers get a drain"
** When learning to juggle, doing brain scan before and after, shows after the anatomy of the brain has changed.
* Socioeconomic status
** When exposed to more stressful neighborhood (along with lower nutrition), major impact on serotonergic activity
** Poorer neighborhood => lower serotonergic responsivity

=== Higher-level functions

* Excursion: Stress and aging
** Quick answer: the more stress, the faster one ages
** Telomeres, located at the end of every chromosome, get smaller on each division, until the cell can no longer divide.
*** A "bookmarker of a cell's biological (versus chronological) age"
** Effects of stress on aging is huge (based on checking telomere lengths): high-stress = 10-20 years older (cellular age)! So "chill out" please ;)
* Self-concept
** Unique ability of human capacity, to reflect on the self.
** Is it just "one other thing we think about", or is it something special/unique? Distinct system for it?
** Yes, it is distinct: medial prefrontal cortex is "selectively engaged during self-referential judgments"
** Yet, it is not "home of the self", as multiple regions are active at the same time (involving self-reflection)
* Moral judgment

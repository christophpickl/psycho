== From Selfest

* Interviewing others about a person is also called hetero-anamnese.
* Doing structured interviews requires training.
* Reactivity is a problem with behavior-observation.
* SCL-90 is used in the Netherlands, measures also hostility/fear and is a multi-dimensional instrument (it does NOT measure relatively stable personality traits).
* Comparing most and least stable subtests of an IQ test is done to check intelligence decline.
* When a person has to build "specific" patterns, this is not part of a projective test; telling a story, fill in words in sentences, drawing, ... is.
* Neuropsychological diagnostic is focused on information processing (and disorders therein).

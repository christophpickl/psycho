== Chapter 11 -  Neurobiological development disorders

. [disorderName]#Autisme-spectrum-stoorniss (ASS)#
. [disorderName]#ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)#

=== Autism (ASS)

* Definition: Serious social/communication skill deficits; stereotypical behavior/interests.
* Diagnosis:
** Often diagnosed later in life, because of above average *intelligence*
** Often semi-structured interviews used
* Symptoms:
** Divergent social reciprocity
*** Lack of awareness of *social conventions*
*** Not knowing at all what to *say* in social situations
*** The inability to spontaneously share *emotions* with others
*** (They indeed can make *eye contact*)
** Divergent non-verbal communication
** Relationship difficulties
** Repetitive behavior/interests (obsessed with certain objects/subjects/activities)
* Neurocognitively limitations with:
** Theory of mind (social insight)
** Central coherence (detailed informationprocessing)
** Executive functions (planning, flexibility)
* Prevention by using folic acid during pregnancy (7-times lower risk of ASS)
* Prevalence
** Less than 1%; more men than women (4:1)
* Treatment
** Usually reducing symptoms of comorbid disorders (anxieties)
** Children: CBT, medication (risperidon)
** Adults: Acceptance through psycho-education
** MBSR seems working

=== ADHD

* Definition: Externalized disorder; inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity.
** Criteria: min. 6 months; symptoms before age 12.
** Adults with ADHD (compared to children): Have less hyperactivity, more distractibility/inattention
* Three subtypes: 1) Inattentive 2) Hyperactive-impulsive 3) Combined
* Diagnosis:
** Difficult in general, as:
*** Adults under-rate symptoms
*** For adults, retrospective diagnose for age before 12
*** Masquerade of symptoms (compensate limitations; extensive organizations to compensate)
*** High comorbidity
** Done in 3 steps:
[arabic]
... Check symptoms via screenings/questionaires (school, work, home, relations)
... Exclude alternative explanations (via semi-structured interviews)
... Check comorbid problems (via hetero-anamnesis)
* Treatment:
** Offer structure (not only to children, but also adults; e.g. use an alarm)
** Medication (stimulantia work for all; contain methylphenidaat, e.g. *Ritalin*)
* Prevalence: 5%; more men than women (2:1)
* History: In past, only diagnosed for children (50% keep diagnose when growing adult)


== Chapter 12 -  Depression and bipolar mood disorders

Disorders:

. [disorderName]#Depressieve stemmingsst.#
.. [disorderName]#Disruptieve-stemmingsdisregulatiest.#
** Persistent irritable mood, violent tantrums ("hevige driftbuien"); Children until 18 years
** Introduced new category as otherwise over-treatment for bipolar disorder
.. [disorderName]#Depressieve st.#
*** Symptoms: depressed mood, *anhedonia* (loss of interest/joy); no (hypo)manic symptoms
**** Also: Significant weight change; insomnia/hypersomnia; psychomotoric agitation/delay; tired; feeling unworthy/guilty; problems concentrating; thinking about death
*** Keep in mind difference between depression and regular mourning (feeling empty and longing for lost person)
*** Learn-theoretically cause: people have not learned to get reward from external world.
*** Biological approach: Genetical factors lead to disruption in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
*** link:../../people/beck-aaron.html[Beck]'s cognitive triad is about negative thoughts about self/world/future
*** link:https://warbletoncouncil.org/teoria-conductual-depresion-lewinsohn-2538[Lewinsohn's Behavioral Theory of Depression]: No reinforcement of actions, no gratification, leading to guilt and low self-esteem.
*** link:https://warbletoncouncil.org/terapia-autocontrol-rehm-813[Rehm's Self-Control Therapy]: from CBT, about self-management (monitoring, assessement, reinforcement)
.. [disorderName]#Persisterende depressieve st. (PSD)#
*** link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia[Dysthyme] (persistent depressive disorder, PDD)
*** Chronic disorder 2+ years; most of days depressed mood; not symptom-free for more than 2 months in a row (for last 2 years)
*** Symptoms: low/high appetite; insomnia/hypersomnia; low energy/tired; low self-esteem; bad concentration; difficulty decisions; hopelessness
*** Case description: for years feels down; tired most of the day; work little pleasure; problems concentrating; now and then better; less energetic then past; lucky periods last never longer than a month
.. [disorderName]#Premenstruele stemmingsst.#
*** Symptoms: Lability, angry, hot temper; personal conflicts; depressed mood, hopelessness, anxiety, tension
**** Also: less interest, difficulties concentrate, lethargy, tired, changed appetite, insomnia/hypersomnia, overwhelmed by emotions, bodily complaints
.. [disorderName]#Depr.stemm.st. door middle/medicatie/somatische aandoening#
*** Medicine, alcohol or other drugs; intoxication (overuse) and abstinence possible cause
*** E.g.: Drugs for cardiovascular diseases; stimulants/appetite suppressants; painkillers/anti-inflammatories; anti-cancer medication; parkinson's; rheumatism; vitamin (B12) deficiencies
. [disorderName]#Bipolaire st.#
** Used to be called "manic depression"
.. [disorderName]#Bipolaire I st.#
*** Symptoms like manic episode; can also be without depressive episodes (though usually predominate).
*** Manic episode: euphoria, hyperactivity, fantastic ideas, lots words, overly excited/irritable
*** Seasonality (manic in summer, depressed in spring/autumn); strong genetic contribution
.. [disorderName]#Bipolaire II st.#
*** Was at least one depressive and one hypomane episode (mild form, not a full mania).
*** Less serious (duration, intensity) than manic epsiode; no limitations of social/work functioning
*** Changes are visible to others (use hetero-anamnese)
*** Diagnose: requires at least heightened energy (3) or irritable mood (4 symptoms)

.. [disorderName]#Bip.st. door middle/medicatie#
.. [disorderName]#Bip.st. door somatische aandoening#

Info:

* Starting point is to differentiate between: depressive / hypomanic / manic epsidoes.
** *Depressive episode*: Uninterrupted 2+ weeks; depressed mood OR no interest/joy
** *Manic episode*: 1+ week; highly irritable, increased energy; daily functioning limited
** *Hypomanic episode*: Same as manic, but: 4+ days; without daily functioning limitations
* Mood episodes need to be evaluated in their seriousness:
** melancholic - experience pleasure
** atypical - reactivity
** psychotic - hallucinations/delusions
** seasonal - winter depression
** peripartum - being pregnant
** mixed episodes - manic/depressive episodes; symptoms of different mood pole present
* Course:
** Remission: complete recover
** Partial remission: some symptoms stay
** Response: 50+% symptoms less
** Relapse: 2+ months recovered but back again
* Assessement:
** Screeningsmethods (questionnaires, checklist)
** Syndromale classification (interviews; for trained clinici)
** Seriousness; intensity/frequency (interviews, rating scales)
* Epidemiology:
** Pointprevelance: 5% (slightly more women than men)
** Half people recover within 3 months
** Comorbid with: anxieties, substance abuse, overweight, ...
* Theoretical views:
** Learn theoretical: link:../../people/skinner-burrhus_frederic.html[Skinner] says, depression is a reduction of the behaviorfrequence due to reduction in reinforcement
** Reinforcement theory / *self-control model*:
*** Not only too little external reward
*** Also rewarding oneself too little & punish oneself too much
*** "Strict for oneself, mild for others"
** Cognitive view:
*** link:../../people/beck-aaron.html[Beck] says: *cognitive triad* (negative view on oneself & future & world)
*** link:../../people/seligman-martin.html[Seligman] says: learned helplessness
** Causal attributes (how do people explain certain things, the why/cause)
*** Intern VS extern:
**** cause is within oneself or outside in the world; "i didn't learn enough" VS "the exam was too difficult"
*** Stable VS instable:
**** things which are changeable or not; "it's just because the way i am" VS "next time i will try harder"
*** Global VS specific
**** generalizing to everything or staying with the particular; "i am just too stupid to get anything" VS "i might not fit for this subject"
*** intern + stable + global = depression; "i am and always will be just too stupid to do anything at all"
** Biological approach:
*** link:../../people/hippocrates-of-kos.html[Hippocrates] already saw biology as base for mood disorders
*** Genetical predisposition (especially bipolar)
*** Dysregulation of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93adrenal_axis[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis] (cortisol=stress => lasting changes to HPA axis)
*** Immunesystem activation (pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as serotonin/noradrenaline)
** Neurobiological approach:
*** Still little results...
*** Currently research, divergent brain parts for diverget emotional regulation
*** Heightened emotionality, due to low prefrontal cortex and high limbic system activity
* Life-events:
** *Diathese-stress model*
** HPA-axis disturbance, leads to depressed schema
** Difference first VS later episodes
** Kindling/scar: every episode makes easier vulnerable for subsequent episodes
* Treatment:
** Staging and profiling model (for bipolar)
*** Staging: stadium of patient; light depression, short intervention; serious depression, psychotherapy & medication
*** Profiling: personalized medicine, based on characteristics of patient choose most fitting therapy
** Internet therapy
** Behavioral therapy: reward by recognition/compliments; strengthen intrinsic motivation
** CBT: negative cognitions
** ITP (InTerPersonal psychotherapy): eclectic; depression in social/interpersonal context
*** Problems divided in: grief, role changes, interpersonal conflicts, interpersonal deficits
* Third wave therapies (CBT based)
** ACT: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (steven hayes); increase cognitive flexibility/acceptance
** MBCT: Mindfullness-Based Cognitive Therapy; prevention of relapse; congitive vulnerability hypothesis; meditation
** CBASP: Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy; chronical depression; reconnect to environment; receptive to feedback

=== Bipolar

* hypomane episdoe: min. 4 days, maniac symptoms, not really limited in daily functioning
* symptoms maniac episode: need less sleep,  easily distracted, "excentric" ideas (=grootheidsideeën)

== Chapter 14 -  Substance abuse

Categories:

. [disorderName]#gebruik van middel#
** Heroin:
*** Effect on CNS: inhibiting, consciousness-lowering effect
*** Compensatoire model (classical conditioning): Heroin overdose often happens in situations the junkie has not been before (body doesn't prepare)

*** Effect on CNS: stimulating
*** E.g. amphetamine, coffeein (body own wekamine: adrenaline)
*** Symptoms intoxication by amphetamines: Much energy, cheerfulness, ability to think clearly, good physical/mental performance
** Tolerance:
*** Postiive tolerance: repeated use, higher dose needed to reach same effect
*** Negative tolerance: repeated use, lower dose needed to reach same effect
*** Stress reduction hypothesis (cognitive school): Good predictor for drinking is "expectation of the effects of drinking"
** Treatment:
*** When severe withdrawal symptoms, intramural (=institutional) admission prior to detoxification.
*** CBT and motivational interviewing.
*** Online counseling programs for reducing alcohol consumption.

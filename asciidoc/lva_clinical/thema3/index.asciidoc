== Chapter 11 -  Neurobiological development disorders

. [disorderName]#Autisme-spectrum-stoorniss (ASS)#
. [disorderName]#ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)#

=== Autism (ASS)

* diagnosis:
** because of above average intelligence, often diagnosed later
** often semi-structured interviews used
* criteria for "divergent social reciprocity":
** lack of awareness of social conventions
** not knowing at all what to say in social situations
** the inability to spontaneously share emotions with others
** (they indeed can make eye contact)

=== ADHD

* adults with ADHD (compared to children):
** have less hyperactivity, more distractibility/inattention
* diagnose:
** three steps:
*** 1) check symptoms via screenings/questionaires
*** 2) symptom cause via semi-structured interviews
*** 3) check comorbidity via hetero-anamnesis
* treatment: medication

== Chapter 12 -  Depression and bipolar mood disorders

. [disorderName]#Depressieve st.#
.. [disorderName]#disruptieve-stemmingsdisregulatiest.#

== Chapter 14 -  Substance abuse

Categories:

. [disorderName]#gebruik van middel#
** Heroin:
*** Effect on CNS: inhibiting, consciousness-lowering effect
*** Compensatoire model (classical conditioning): Heroin overdose often happens in situations the junkie has not been before (body doesn't prepare)
** Wekamine (old term, not used these days anymore; "Weckmittel"):
*** Effect on CNS: stimulating
*** E.g. amphetamine, coffeein (body own wekamine: adrenaline)
*** Symptoms intoxication by amphetamines: Much energy, cheerfulness, ability to think clearly, good physical/mental performance
** Tolerance:
*** Postiive tolerance: repeated use, higher dose needed to reach same effect
*** Negative tolerance: repeated use, lower dose needed to reach same effect
*** Stress reduction hypothesis (cognitive school): Good predictor for drinking is "expectation of the effects of drinking"
** Treatment:
*** When severe withdrawal symptoms, intramural (=institutional) admission prior to detoxification.
*** CBT and motivational interviewing.
*** Online counseling programs for reducing alcohol consumption.

** There are neurological symptoms (numbness, blindness, paralysis), which are not consistent with a well-established organic cause, which cause significant distress, and can be traced back to a psychological trigger.

** Case: A woman lost a child during a traffic accident; since then more conflicts with her husband; goes to GP because of back pain, referral physiotherapy, pain is gone; later she complains about a numb leg, nothing (physiologically) can be found which could be the cause; now also the left arm starts to be numb.

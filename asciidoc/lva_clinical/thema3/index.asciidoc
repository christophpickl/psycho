== Chapter 11 - Neurobiological development disorders

. [disorderName]#Autisme-spectrum-stoorniss (ASS)#
. [disorderName]#ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)#

=== Autism (ASS)

* Definition: Serious social/communication skill deficits; stereotypical behavior/interests.
* Diagnosis:
** Often diagnosed later in life, because of above average *intelligence*
** Often semi-structured interviews used
* Symptoms:
** Divergent social reciprocity
*** Lack of awareness of *social conventions*
*** Not knowing at all what to *say* in social situations
*** The inability to spontaneously share *emotions* with others
*** (They indeed can make *eye contact*)
** Divergent non-verbal communication
** Relationship difficulties
** Repetitive behavior/interests (obsessed with certain objects/subjects/activities)
* Neurocognitively limitations with:
** Theory of mind (social insight)
** Central coherence (detailed informationprocessing)
** Executive functions (planning, flexibility)
* Prevention by using folic acid during pregnancy (7-times lower risk of ASS)
* Prevalence
** Less than 1%; more men than women (4:1)
* Treatment
** Usually reducing symptoms of comorbid disorders (anxieties)
** Children: CBT, medication (risperidon)
** Adults: Acceptance through psycho-education
** MBSR seems working

=== ADHD

* Definition: Externalized disorder; inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity.
** Criteria: min. 6 months; symptoms before age 12.
** Adults with ADHD (compared to children): Have less hyperactivity, more distractibility/inattention
* Three subtypes: 1) Inattentive 2) Hyperactive-impulsive 3) Combined
* Diagnosis:
** Difficult in general, as:
*** Adults under-rate symptoms
*** For adults, retrospective diagnose for age before 12
*** Masquerade of symptoms (compensate limitations; extensive organizations to compensate)
*** High comorbidity
** Done in 3 steps:
[arabic]
... Check symptoms via screenings/questionaires (school, work, home, relations)
... Exclude alternative explanations (via semi-structured interviews)
... Check comorbid problems (via hetero-anamnesis)
* Treatment:
** Offer structure (not only to children, but also adults; e.g. use an alarm)
** Medication (stimulantia work for all; contain methylphenidaat, e.g. *Ritalin*)
* Prevalence: 5%; more men than women (2:1)
* History: In past, only diagnosed for children (50% keep diagnose when growing adult)


== Chapter 12 - Depression and bipolar mood disorders

=== Depressieve stemmingsst

. [disorderName]#Disruptieve-stemmingsdisregulatiest.#
* Persistent irritable mood, violent tantrums ("hevige driftbuien"); Children until 18 years
* Introduced new category as otherwise over-treatment for bipolar disorder
. [disorderName]#Depressieve st.#
** Symptoms: depressed mood, *anhedonia* (loss of interest/joy); no (hypo)manic symptoms
*** Also: Significant weight change; insomnia/hypersomnia; psychomotoric agitation/delay; tired; feeling unworthy/guilty; problems concentrating; thinking about death
** Keep in mind difference between depression and regular mourning (feeling empty and longing for lost person)
** Learn-theoretically cause: people have not learned to get reward from external world.
** Biological approach: Genetical factors lead to disruption in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
** link:../../people/beck-aaron.html[Beck]'s cognitive triad is about negative thoughts about self/world/future
** link:https://warbletoncouncil.org/teoria-conductual-depresion-lewinsohn-2538[Lewinsohn's Behavioral Theory of Depression]: No reinforcement of actions, no gratification, leading to guilt and low self-esteem.
** link:https://warbletoncouncil.org/terapia-autocontrol-rehm-813[Rehm's Self-Control Therapy]: from CBT, about self-management (monitoring, assessement, reinforcement)
. [disorderName]#Persisterende depressieve st. (PSD)#
** link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia[Dysthyme] (persistent depressive disorder, PDD)
** Chronic disorder 2+ years; most of days depressed mood; not symptom-free for more than 2 months in a row (for last 2 years)
** Symptoms: low/high appetite; insomnia/hypersomnia; low energy/tired; low self-esteem; bad concentration; difficulty decisions; hopelessness
** Case description: for years feels down; tired most of the day; work little pleasure; problems concentrating; now and then better; less energetic then past; lucky periods last never longer than a month
. [disorderName]#Premenstruele stemmingsst.#
** Symptoms: Lability, angry, hot temper; personal conflicts; depressed mood, hopelessness, anxiety, tension
*** Also: less interest, difficulties concentrate, lethargy, tired, changed appetite, insomnia/hypersomnia, overwhelmed by emotions, bodily complaints
. [disorderName]#Depr.stemm.st. door middle/medicatie/somatische aandoening#
** Medicine, alcohol or other drugs; intoxication (overuse) and abstinence possible cause
** E.g.: Drugs for cardiovascular diseases; stimulants/appetite suppressants; painkillers/anti-inflammatories; anti-cancer medication; parkinson's; rheumatism; vitamin (B12) deficiencies

=== Bipolaire st.

* hypomane episdoe: min. 4 days, maniac symptoms, not really limited in daily functioning
* symptoms maniac episode: need less sleep,  easily distracted, "excentric" ideas (=grootheidsideeën)
* Used to be called "manic depression"
. [disorderName]#Bipolaire I st.#
** Symptoms like manic episode; can also be without depressive episodes (though usually predominate).
** Manic episode: euphoria, hyperactivity, fantastic ideas, lots words, overly excited/irritable
** Seasonality (manic in summer, depressed in spring/autumn); strong genetic contribution
. [disorderName]#Bipolaire II st.#
** Was at least one depressive and one hypomane episode (mild form, not a full mania).
** Less serious (duration, intensity) than manic epsiode; no limitations of social/work functioning
** Changes are visible to others (use hetero-anamnese)
** Diagnose: requires at least heightened energy (3) or irritable mood (4 symptoms)
*** Symptoms: inflated ego; minder sleep need; change of talkativeness; avoiding thinking; excessive activities; psychomotoric agitation
. [disorderName]#Cyclothyme st.#
** Mild form; Problems in social life
** 2+ years suffering from hypomane and depressed symptoms (symptomfree for not longer than 2 months)
. [disorderName]#Bip.st. door middle/medicatie#
. [disorderName]#Bip.st. door somatische aandoening#

=== Info

* Starting point is to differentiate between: depressive / hypomanic / manic epsidoes.
** *Depressive episode*: Uninterrupted 2+ weeks; depressed mood OR no interest/joy
** *Manic episode*: 1+ week; highly irritable, increased energy; daily functioning limited
** *Hypomanic episode*: Same as manic, but: 4+ days; without daily functioning limitations
* Mood episodes need to be evaluated in their seriousness:
** melancholic - experience pleasure
** atypical - reactivity
** psychotic - hallucinations/delusions
** seasonal - winter depression
** peripartum - being pregnant
** mixed episodes - manic/depressive episodes; symptoms of different mood pole present
* Course:
** Remission: complete recover
** Partial remission: some symptoms stay
** Response: 50+% symptoms less
** Relapse: 2+ months recovered but back again
* Assessement:
** Screeningsmethods (questionnaires, checklist)
** Syndromale classification (interviews; for trained clinici)
** Seriousness; intensity/frequency (interviews, rating scales)
* Epidemiology:
** Pointprevelance: 5% (slightly more women than men)
** Half people recover within 3 months
** Comorbid with: anxieties, substance abuse, overweight, ...
* Theoretical views:
** Learn theoretical: link:../../people/skinner-burrhus_frederic.html[Skinner] says, depression is a reduction of the behaviorfrequence due to reduction in reinforcement
** Reinforcement theory / *self-control model*:
*** Not only too little external reward
*** Also rewarding oneself too little & punish oneself too much
*** "Strict for oneself, mild for others"
** Cognitive view:
*** link:../../people/beck-aaron.html[Beck] says: *cognitive triad* (negative view on oneself & future & world)
*** link:../../people/seligman-martin.html[Seligman] says: learned helplessness
** Causal attributes (how do people explain certain things, the why/cause)
*** Intern VS extern:
**** cause is within oneself or outside in the world; "i didn't learn enough" VS "the exam was too difficult"
*** Stable VS instable:
**** things which are changeable or not; "it's just because the way i am" VS "next time i will try harder"
*** Global VS specific
**** generalizing to everything or staying with the particular; "i am just too stupid to get anything" VS "i might not fit for this subject"
*** intern + stable + global = depression; "i am and always will be just too stupid to do anything at all"
** Biological approach:
*** link:../../people/hippocrates-of-kos.html[Hippocrates] already saw biology as base for mood disorders
*** Genetical predisposition (especially bipolar)
*** Dysregulation of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93adrenal_axis[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis] (cortisol=stress => lasting changes to HPA axis)
*** Immunesystem activation (pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as serotonin/noradrenaline)
** Neurobiological approach:
*** Still little results...
*** Currently research, divergent brain parts for diverget emotional regulation
*** Heightened emotionality, due to low prefrontal cortex and high limbic system activity
* Life-events:
** *Diathese-stress model*
** HPA-axis disturbance, leads to depressed schema
** Difference first VS later episodes
** Kindling/scar: every episode makes easier vulnerable for subsequent episodes
* Treatment:
** Staging and profiling model (for bipolar)
*** Staging: stadium of patient; light depression, short intervention; serious depression, psychotherapy & medication
*** Profiling: personalized medicine, based on characteristics of patient choose most fitting therapy
** Internet therapy
** Behavioral therapy: reward by recognition/compliments; strengthen intrinsic motivation
** CBT: negative cognitions
** ITP (InTerPersonal psychotherapy): eclectic; depression in social/interpersonal context
*** Problems divided in: grief, role changes, interpersonal conflicts, interpersonal deficits
* Third wave therapies (CBT based)
** ACT: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (steven hayes); increase cognitive flexibility/acceptance
** MBCT: Mindfullness-Based Cognitive Therapy; prevention of relapse; congitive vulnerability hypothesis; meditation
** CBASP: Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy; chronical depression; reconnect to environment; receptive to feedback

** Subtypes:
... Animals
... Natural phenomena (e.g. height, mountains, water, weather)
... Injections
... Situations (tunnels, flying, elevators)
... Others (situations leading to choking/vomiting)
** Suffering is often less than of other psychological disorders
** Often children have it, and they also disappear by themselves; they usually never disappear with adults.
** Symptoms:
*** Phobic object/situation immediately evokes fear
*** Phobic object/situation is avoided, or tolerated only with intense fear

. [disorderName]#Paniekst.#
** Definition: Recurrent panic attacks, that occur unexpectedly for no apparent reason
** Panic attack: Abrupt wave of intense fear/discomfort, peaking within minutes
*** Having a panic attack, does NOT mean to have a panic disorder!

** Most of patients say always have been a worrier
** Diagnose:
*** Fear of multiple events/activities

=== Info

* Anxieties are the most prevalent psychological disorders
** Social phobia is the most common anxiety disorder
* Comorbidity is super high (60-90%), usually with: mood disorders, drug abuse
* Fear response consists of:
.. subjective feeling of fear
.. physiological reactions
.. cognitive component
* Anxiety disorders share those (subjective feeling, physiological reactions)
** As well as: avoiding behavior and irrational thoughts
* Fear is a useful phenomena
** Goal: prepare for flight-or-fight response
** It gets pathological if it interferes with daily functioning
** Taken into consideration: intensity, duration, type of events evoking the fear
* Individuele casus-conceptualisatie: sequential/referential association
* *Stagering* creating distinct phases, *profilering* creating specific criteria, of patients with different prognosis/treatments
* Theories:
** Biopsychosocial model: natura (biological factors, genes) VS nurture (environment, life experiences)
** Biological theories:
*** Neurotransmittersystem: noradrenaline, serotonin, GABA (see link:../../lva_introduction/ch4-neural/neurotransmitters.html[neurotransmitters page])
*** Fear network: amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
* Etiology:
** Psychologically: Behvioral model (classical/operant conditioning, avoiding/safety-behavior)
** Cognitivially: Schemas (perception, memory, bias, core believes)
* Assessment:
** Process:
... Clarify nature/seriousness of symptoms
... Make valid diagnose
... Exclude alternative diagnoses
... Create a "case conceptualization" (theory how individual complaints arisen/maintained)
**** Sequential associations => exposure treatment
**** Referential associations => no exposure treatment
** Checklist for assessement:
*** DSM-classification
*** seriousness/frequency of symptoms
*** important characteristics of complaints
*** relevant (social) skills
*** development/progress of complaints
*** treatment history/preference
*** family factors
*** health factors
** How is assessed?
*** Interview (SCID-I)
*** Self (fear) questionaire
*** Methods of self registration / observations (diary)
* Treatment:
** Pharmacological: anti-depressiva (SSRIs)
** CBT; 3 phased:
... start phase:
**** inventory/diagnostic of complaints/problems
**** formulate help request
**** functional analysis: how to solve the bad, which negatives prevent goal
**** meaning analysis: how is neutral situation interpreted (e.g.: "if i see a dog, it will bite me"")
... middle phase:
**** Execute interventions (described in treatment plan)
**** E.g.: psycho-education, journaling, relaxation, cognitive restructuring, exposure, response prevention, skill training
... end phase:
**** usually short (3 session)
**** transfer of change: patient does it by himself
**** prevent relapse
**** end evaluation and good bye
* Misc:
** After 7 years, in NL, 50% don't qualify the criteria for anxiety anymore
** Poor the ones (progress wise) for those with anxiety and mood disorder
** Relapse is frequent
** *Subthreshold-symptoms* can still limit daily functioning

."Fear network", containing of: amygdala, insula, anterior cingulate cortex

== Chapter 14 - Substance abuse, addiction

=== Disorders

. [disorderName]#Gebruik van middel#
** "Aan een middel gebonden stoornis"
*** Disorder in usage of a substance (addiction) VS disorder created by a substance (intoxication, withdrawal, others like depression)
** Withdrawal/abstinence
*** Happens if stop/reduce after frequent use. Substance-specific withdrawal syndrome develops (social/occupational dysfunctioning)
*** Drugs with short *half-life* (=time to halve the blood level of the drug), syndrome develops more quickly
** Substance groups:
*** According to DSM-5, 10 different ones: Alcohol, cannabis, link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phencyclidine[phencyclidine] (alias PCP, angel dust), hallucinogens, inhalants (e.g. glue), opioids, hypnotics (e.g. sleep medication), stimulants (e.g. cocaine), tobacco, residual category (e.g. anabolic steroids)
*** Narcotics:
**** Consciousness-lowering drugs
**** Alcohol, opioids (morphine, heroin, codeine, methadone), hypnotics (barbiturates)
**** Anxiolytics (benzodiazepines) are sedating, yet not lowering consciousness
**** Are pain-reducing/inhibitory on the CNS
**** Withdrawal symptoms: sweating, fast hearbeat, nausea, insomnia (specifics differ per drug)
**** Withdrawal with perceptual disturbances: hallucinations/illusions, while reality check works, and no delirium
*** Stimulants:
**** Amphetamines, cocaine, tobacco
**** Stimulating the nervous system
**** Tolerance increase with repeated use (need more for same effect)
*** Psychodelics (consciousness altering substances)
**** So-called "trips"
** Specific substances:
*** THC
**** Cannabis, phencyclidines (PCP), hallucinogens, inhalants
**** Active ingredient in cannabis is THC (tetra-hydro-cannabinol)
**** Has negative tolerance: repeated use, lower dose needed ("high" feeling, eating flash, laugh flash)
**** High dosage can cause hallucinations
*** LSD
**** The most famous hallucinogen
**** Confused sense of time; consciousness/spatial orientation intact
**** Synesthesia: mixing sensory experiences (hearing a picture, seeing music, feeling colors; "the number 8 is clearly blue, and so is friday")
**** Often panic during a bad trip
**** Symptoms: dilated pupils, high heart rate, sweating, slow breathing
*** XTC
**** Ecstasy, an amphetamine-like agent
**** Mind-altering and stimulant (unclear how to classify); properties of hallucinogenic agents
**** Symptoms: euphoric, extra energy, warm emotions, empathy, self-insight, sensuality, relaxation, pain relief
**** Also symptoms: nausea, headache, shortness of breath, clammy ahnds, chills
*** GHB
**** Gamma-Hydroxy-Butyric acid; natural occuring neurotransmitter
**** Party drug
**** Effects: narcotic (relaxation), hallucinogen (euphoric), aphrodisiac
**** Symptoms: sudden/intensive use cause severe withdrawal syndrome (anxiety, tremor, motor restlessness; hallucinations, delirium)
*** Cocaine
**** A stimulant
**** Cocian dysphoria, with cornic use (depressed mood, anxiety, concentration problems, fatigue, crying)
**** overdose: tremor, seizures
**** Withdrawal: sadness, gloom (=truebsinn), over-tiredness, sleeping problems
*** Heroin
**** Effect on CNS: inhibiting, consciousness-lowering effect
**** Compensatoire model (classical conditioning): Heroin overdose often happens in situations the junkie has not been before (body doesn't prepare)
*** Wekamine
**** "Wekamine" is an old term, not used these days anymore; "Weckmittel"
**** Effect on CNS: stimulating
**** E.g. amphetamine, coffeein (body own wekamine: adrenaline)
**** Symptoms intoxication by amphetamines: Much energy, cheerfulness, ability to think clearly, good physical/mental performance
*** Phencyclidine
**** Alias: PCP, angel dust
**** Dissociative hallucinogenic drug; typically smoked (also swallowed, snorted or injected)
** Tolerance:
*** *Postiive tolerance*: repeated use, higher dose needed to reach same effect
*** *Negative tolerance*: repeated use, lower dose needed to reach same effect
*** *Stress reduction hypothesis* (cognitive school): Good predictor for drinking is "expectation of the effects of drinking"
** Treatment:
*** When severe withdrawal symptoms, intramural (=institutional) admission prior to detoxification.
*** CBT and motivational interviewing.
*** Online counseling programs for reducing alcohol consumption.
. [disorderName]#gokst. (gambling)#
** The only non-substance related addiction in DSM-5 (internet/computer games not yet)
** Gambling stimulates the reward center (dopamine) just like drugs
** Min 4 criteria last 12 months (mild = 4-5, moderate = 6-7, serious, 8-9 criteria)
** Criteria:
*** Tolerance like: Have to gamble with more money, achieve same excitement
*** Restless/irritable when trying to stop/reduce
*** Repeated failures to stop/reduce
*** Preoccupation with it
*** Gambling with uneasy feelings
*** Often (after losing) comes back to recoup loss
*** Lies to disguise (seriousness of gambling behavior)
*** Endangers relationships/work/education
*** Borrows money for gambling

=== Info

* Definition: Problematic pattern of abuse (of a substance), leading to significant limitations/suffering
* Criteria:
** Use of large amounts, or for longer than was intended
** Persistent desire/futile attempts to reduce
** Big time investment (getting, using, recovering)
** Craving for it
** Often use, despite not fulfilling role at work/school/home
** Contued use, although social problems by it
** Other activities abandoned/reduced for it
** Usage where it poses physical danger
** Usage although knowing it could lead to physical/psychological problems
** Tolerance
** Withdrawal symptoms
* Major changes between DSM 4 and 5
** Seriousness score from 2-11: 2-3 low, 4-5 middle, 6+ serious
* Criteria: control lost, social limitations (due to addiction), risky use, pharmacological criteria
** CAVE: Excessive use is not a criteria!
* Remission:
** If not meeting criteria (except cravings) for 3+ months
** Early remission: Within first 12 months (risk highest here for relapse)
** Long-term remission: After 12 months
** Important to consider whether patient is in a controlled environment or not (can he obtain the drug himself?)
* Prevalence
** Most occuring 16-24 years
** Alcohol and smoking are biggest problems (people's health and costs for society)
** In NL: 1/20 alcohol addicted (in life time); 25% smokes daily tabacco; 1mio use benzodiazepin; 24k hard users (90% addicted of them)
* History
** Dutch "verslaving" from "enslave someone" (18th century); only after that "psychological dependency"
** End 19th century, addiction seen as moral problem, weakness of character (it's the person's guilt)
** Contingency Management: reinforce alternative behavior (such as *Community Reinforcement Approach*)
* Biomedical science:
** 50% of addiction is due to genetical factors
** People with externalized traits: use as kick/intoxication/anti-boredom
** People with internalized traits use relive anxiety/mood/shyness
** Genes influence how much, not when they start drinking
* Learn theortical approach:
** Classical conditioning:
*** Compensatory model
**** No cues without intake, no intake without cues.
**** Tolerance is situation-specific.
*** Appetizing model
**** Cues elicit reactions that resemble the drug effect (iso-directional), not only compensatory responses
**** Craving is not the result of opposing compensatory responses.
*** Sensitization model
**** Activation of the sensitized reward system depends on the cues predicting the drug effect (not always consciously, may be associated with/without craving)
**** Moods can act as conditioned stimulus.
** Operant conditioning:
*** Cognitive determinants: perceived self-efficacy; outcome expectations; stress reduction hypothesis
*** Automatic processes: Attentional bias; implicit memory sizes; tendency to approach
*** Social context: others who invite you to use it
* Treatment
** Detoxifying / Reduce cravings: Opioids => Methadon; Alcohol => Disulfiram; Tabacco => Nicotin replacements
** Motivational interviewing:
*** express empathy; strengthen self-efficacy; use resistance; increase ambivalence
** CBT:
*** Change addiction habit, better cope with life problems
*** When serious addiction, combine it with motivational interviewing
** E-mental-health:
*** online self-help
*** blended-care treatments (face-to-face therapist and online interventions)
*** computer training to influence attentional bias

== Chapter 15 - Somatosymptomic disorders

Disorders:

. [disorderName]#somatisch-symptoomst.#
** Criteria:
*** Causes distress / disrupts functioning
*** Present +6 months
*** Not physical complaints themselves, but how experienced/shown is important
** Diagnosis:
*** One or more physical complaints (patient suffers from it)
*** Excessive thoughts/feelings/behaviors regarding health complaints, or
**** disproportional/persistent thoughts about complaint severity
**** High concern about health/complaints
**** High time/energy investment on health/complaints
*** Having complaints in total for 6+ months (not meaning, that every individual complaint has to be always present)
** Relevant factors (according model from Looper and Kirmayer): avoidance, seeking reassurance, catastrophing
** Treatment: CBT (better than nothing/pseudo treatment)
** Prevelance 5%; more men than women
** Etiology is unclear; risk factors were identified:
*** Psychotrauma in youth; female; older; lower education; lower socio-economic class; high in neuroticism
. [disorderName]#ziekte-angstst.#
** Alias "Hypochondria"
** Description:
*** (Disproportional) busy with getting/having serious illness
*** Physical complaints are mild/absent
*** Anxiety about one's own health
*** Excessive health-related behavior / maladaptive avoidance
*** Preoccupation for 6+ month (specific diseases feared may change)
** Is: excessive worries about having a serious (not-diagnosed) illness.
** Case: Often pain at her nose; going to GP often; comes up with self-diagnosis; although GP confirms there is nothing, worries continue; excessive self-treatment.
** To have also anxieties/depressions doesn't have a bad impact on the development

[#img-ziekteangst]
.Circulair model van ziekteangst
image::ziekteangst_circulair_model.png[Ziekteangst,200,100]

[start=3]
. [disorderName]#Conversiest.#
** "Functional neurologic symptom disorder"
** Description:
*** Is a functional, neurological symptom disorder
*** Change in voluntary motor/sensory function
*** Symptoms incompatible with known neurological/medical condition
*** It cannot be explained by a mental disorder
*** Acute episode +6 months
** There are neurological symptoms (numbness, blindness, paralysis), which are not consistent with a well-established organic cause, which cause significant distress, and can be traced back to a psychological trigger.
** Stress (conflicts) seem to be associated with the onset/worsening of symptoms.
** Case: A woman lost a child during a traffic accident; since then more conflicts with her husband; goes to GP because of back pain, referral physiotherapy, pain is gone; later she complains about a numb leg, nothing (physiologically) can be found which could be the cause; now also the left arm starts to be numb.
** Prevelance about 5%; 3x more often women
. [disorderName]#Psychic factors somatic influences#
. [disorderName]#Nagebootste st.#
** Alias "Pathomimie" or "Münchhausensyndrom" (injury to self) and "Münchhausen by proxy" (injury to others)
** Imitated disorder; pretending physical/psychological complaints; deliberate induction of injury/illness (deception)
*** Presenting to others as sick/disabled/injured
*** Deceptive behavior is evident, even in the absence of clear external rewards

.Circular model for chronic pain ("fear avoidance model")
image::chronic_pain_avoidance.png[Chronic pain avoidance,200,100]

=== Info

* Diagnosis:
** Complaints anamnesis dimensions: somatic, cognitive, emotional, behavioral, social
** Check for comorbidity
** Examples questionaires:
*** McGill Pain Questionnaire -- pain
*** Checklist Individuele Spankracht (CIS) -- tiredness
*** Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) -- indications bodily/psychological complaints
* About treatment:
** Somatic treatment is no solution (can even cause "iatrogenic damage")
*** iatrogenic = unintentional complication (words/actions; infection) resulting from physician's medical activity (diagnosis, intervention, error)
** More acceptance, if doctors involved in collaboration
** Confronting patient with simulated disorder is counterproductive:
*** Ffind out the profit of the illness behavior
*** Look for adaptive behaviors for disease gain
*** Ensure that the client can report complaints without losing face
*** Immediate intervention is necessary if there is a high risk of iatrogenic injury!
* Treatment methods:
** Mindfulness-based therapy
** CBT
** E-health CBT
** Relaxation exercises
** Attention training
** Cognitive interventions
** Behavioral experiment
** Exposure-Response Prevention
** Exposure and graded activity
** System interventions around the complaint

== Chapter 16 - Sleeping disorders

=== Disorders

. [disorderName]#Insomniast.#
** Has the highest comorbidity of all sleeping disorders.

*** Falling asleep (+30mins)
*** Staying asleep (wake up for 30mins)
*** Wake up too early / not sleep through (-6.5hrs)
*** +3 nights a week; +3 months; happens although opportunity to sleep
** Psycho-physiological insomnia: a learned/conditioned form (worrying can't sleep)
** 10% have a chronic form
** After menopoause, 50-100% more complaints about insomnia/fatigue
** More often among 65+ people (30% have chronic insomnia)

=== Info

* Two neurological processes regulate sleep-wake rhythm:
** *Homeostatic* increases during day
*** Energy investment to stay awake creates waste products; the higher the concentration, the higher the sleep need
** *Circadian* decreases during day;
*** Rhythmic process with about 24 hours (a bit more) measured by brain's biological clock
** See link:#img-sleep-processes[sleep processes graph]
* Different sleep stages/stadiums (in multiple cycles); see link:#img-sleep-brain-waves[sleep EEG/brainwaves diagram]
** Awake: Beta waves.
** Stage 1: Theta waves
*** Transition from wake to sleep.
** Stage 2:
*** Sleep spindles; actual onset of sleep
*** Makes up 50% of sleep together with stage 1
** Stage 3+4: Delta waves
*** Deep sleep/slow-wave sleep (slow, large EEG waves)
*** Difficult to wake up
*** Makes up 20% of sleep
** REM (Rapid Eye Movement):
*** Fast random waves
*** Dreams happen; reduction muscle tension; fluctuations heart rate/blood pressure
*** First REM happens after 1 hour after falling asleep
*** Makes up 25% of sleep
** Non-REM/REM cycle:
*** The REM episodes occur about every hour and a half throughout the night.
*** The first episode lasts less than 5 minutes and the last about 25 minutes.
* To research sleep(problems), the following measures can be taken:
** EEG (electro-encephalo-gram): electrical brain activity
** EOG (electro-oculo-gram): eye movements
** EMG (electro-myo-gram): muscle tension
** ECG (electro-cardio-gram): heart beat
** Polysomnogram: nosa/mouth airstream, chest/belly breathing, leg movements, oxygen saturation in arteries
* Between 10-20 years more evening person, after age 20 shift towards morning person
* Anamnesis aspects:
** sleep complaints; sleep-wake schedule; history; sleeping conditions (sleep hygiene); lifestyle; medical status; psychological status

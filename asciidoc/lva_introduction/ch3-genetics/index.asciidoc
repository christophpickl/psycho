== Keypeople

== Basics

=== Chromosomes

* Sexual Reproduction
** Mitosos
*** Identical
*** All* cells divide
** Meiosis
*** Random, mutation
*** Egg/sperm
** Zygote
*** Egg/sperm fusion
*** Twins
**** Monoygotic, identical
**** Dizygotic, fraternal
* 23 Pairs
** Locus
*** Homozygous
*** Heterzygous
**** Alleles: dominant / recessive
** 1 Sex Pair
*** XX Female
*** XY Male

.22 numbered chromosomes and remaining two labeled X/Y.

.Schematic illustration of meiosis in sperm production (3 instead of 23 paris).
image::images/meiosis_sperm.jpg[Meiosis,400,100]

.Gene loci on a pair of chromosomes: 1,3,5 are homozygous, 2,4 are heterozygous (and also alleles).
image::images/chromosome_loci.jpg[Gene loci,200,100]

=== Genes

* Genes > Chromosomes > DNA
* About 20k, same as chimps/mice
* Protein synthesis
** Amino Acids
** Enzymes: Control chemical reactions
* Influence behavior
** Indirect control
** Bodily structures

.How genes affect behavior: Genes build proteins which change physiological systems (brain) which produce behavior, always with some environment.
image::images/gene_effect.jpg[Gene effect,400,100]


.DNA pulled from a chromosome, with nucleotide bases, double helix wrappings, and epigenetic modifications.
image::images/dna_helix.jpg[DNA helix,300,100]

=== Misc

* Types:
** Phenotype: Observables
** Genotype: Inherited
* Heredity:
** Mendel
** Pea plants
** Dominant / recessive
** Fixed ratio
** Example: Sickle-cell anemia, leading to anti-malaria

.Mendel's 3:1 ratio (_R_ = dominant, round; _r_ = recessive, wrinkle allele)
image::images/mendel_31_ration.jpg[Mendel,200,100]

== Inheritance

* Singel/Mendelian
** Categorical
** Fearful dogs
** Influence environment
* Polygenic
** Continuous
*** Normal distribution
** Selective breeding
*** Tyron's maze rats
*** Russian tame foxes
* Epigenetics
** Genes turned on/off
** Transgenerational
*** E.g. Dutch hunger winter

.Scott and Fuller's dog results, when mating: _F_ = dominant, fearful; _f_ = recessive, not fearful

.Making foxes tame by selectively breeding them: After 30 generations, as friendly to humans as dogs.

.Tyron's maze rats: Selective breeding made some "maze bright" and some "maze dull".
image::images/mice_maze.jpg[Tyron's maze rats,300,100]

== Natural Selection

* Natural versus artificial breeding
* Concepts
** Offspring overproduction
** Traits variation
*** Mutation
**** Replication "errors"
**** Meiosis
** Inherited differences
** Fit environment
*** Survive/offspring
* "Rapid Evolution"
** Environmental changes
** Finches
*** Seeds, beaks
* Foresight Mistakes
[arabic]
.. No future purpose
.. No ranking
.. No morality, "naturalistic fallacy"

.Rapid evolution changed the shape of the beaks of the birds due to change in food availability by natural selection.
image::images/rapid_evolution_bird_beaks.jpg[Rapid evolution,300,100]

=== Functionalism

* Genetic drift
* Explanations
** Distal
*** Next generation
*** Ultimate causation
** Proximal
*** Immediately
** Phenomena
*** Adaptation
**** E.g. Umbilical chord, naval button
*** Side-effects
*** By-products
*** Chance
** Vestigial characteristics
*** E.g. baby grasping (hair of chimp mother)

=== "Instincts"

* Alias: "Species-typical behavior"
// TODO explain why book emphasizes this
* Cross-species
** Homology
*** Common ancestor
*** E.g. apes and us share some
** Analogy
*** Convergent evolution
*** Inferring distal functions
*** E.g. Wings in different species (no common ancestor)
** 2 distinct smiles
* Biological preparedness
** Anatomical structures
*** E.g. pelvis tilt to walk upright
** Permit/motivate certain behavior
* 6 basic emotional expressions
** Even blind people show them.
* Examples
** Eyebrow flash
** Sparrow's song

.6 basic human emotional expressions (taken from Ekman and Friesen's atlas).

.The universal eyebrow flash.
image::images/eyebrow_flash.jpg[Eyebrow flash,600,100]

.Humans split off from the ancestral line 6 million years ago from the apes, and 30 million years ago from the "Old World monkeys".

.These wings are analogies, not homologies, because they arose independently in evolution.

== Evolutionary Analysis

=== Mating

* Systems
** Monogamy
*** Sexual or social
** Polygyny
** Polyandry
** Promiscuity
* Parental investment
** Triver's theory
** Competition
*** Size, strength
*** Aggressiveness
* Humans
** Compared to Bonobos :)
** Un-/faithfulness
** Jealousy
** Romantic love
** Bonding

.Four mating systems.

.Male elephant seals fighting over mating rights, the bigger wins, thus reproducing.
image::images/strong_zeehonden.jpg[Fighting animals over mating rights,400,100]

.The spotted sandpiper is a polyandrous species, and this female is stretching her wings in a threat display. She mates with several males, and defends her territory from invading females.
image::images/polyandrous_bird.jpg[Polyandrous bird,400,100]

.The superb fairy wren is socially, but not sexually monogamous. 75% of offspring on average are from neighboring males.
image::images/semi_monogamy.jpg[Semi monogamy,400,100]

.Bonobos live by the motto "make love, not war", most sexually active and most peaceful of all primates. Hetero- as well as homosexual in all imaginable positions.
image::images/bonobo_sex.jpg[Bonobo sex,400,100]

.The evolutionary psychology of love.
image::images/love_evolutionary_psychology.jpg[Love Evolutionary Psychology,400,100]

=== Aggression

* Resources
** Food
** Mates
** Shelter
** Social status
* Forced Sex
** Male
** Increase reproduction
** Pass genes
*** Imoral

.Human's are still behaving like apes.
image::images/human_ape_behavior.jpg[Human ape behavior,300,100]

=== Helping

* Cooperation
** Work together
** Helping self
** Increase chances
* Altruism
** Theories
*** Kin selection
**** Relatives
**** Gene survival
**** Wording
***** Sub topic
***** Brother, sister ("Vaterland")
*** Reciprocity
**** Long-term cooperation
**** E.g. when receiving a present, wanting to give a favor back
** Helping others
*** At cost of oneself
*** Broader view: Not truly
* Promote others survival/reproduction

.This alarm-calling ground squirrel spotted a predator, whereas only females show this behavior, not males.

.Vampire bats share some of the ingested blood meal with others that have fed them in the past; reciprocal altruism.

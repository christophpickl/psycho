=== Parenting Styles

Or: Baumrind's disciplinary study

* Example of a link:/introduction/ch2-methods/index.html#sec-design[correlational study].
* Diana Baumrind (1971) studied the relationship between parents' disciplinary styles, and children's behavioral development.
** Three styles:
*** Authoritarian: Obey for the sake of it
*** Authoritative: Understand the rules
**** Best in: Happiness, friendliness, cooperation
*** Permissive: Do whatever
** Children ratings: cooperation, friendliness, etc.
* Finding: Authoritative parents scored better than others.
** BUT: Only correlation proven, not cause-effect!
** It was not an experiment, tweaking the variables through manipulation.
*** Maybe the children's behavior influenced the parent's style?
*** Maybe the causal relationship goes in both direction?
*** Maybe there is another, third variable at play, e.g.: Genes, income, health, neighbourhood.

=== Play

* Outcome opinions:
** Piaget: Learn rules; better moral reasoners
** Vygotsky: Self-control
* Promotes skills: For survival, culture-specific ones (by observing adults)
* Age-mixed: Less competitive, better teach/learn

* Prediction; validity?
** Big Five is better than chance
** Age-stability? When older: More conscientous, more agreeable, less neurotic, less open
** Also changes due to life events
* Genetics
** 0.5 heritability
** Environment makes no big difference
** Gene alleles: Moderate success so far

=== Adaption

* Advantages
** Analgoy of financial investment: Protection, diversification
** Alternative strategies help survival/reproduction
* Family
** "Split-parent identification" helps less sibling rivalry and diverse parental investment
** Siblings:
*** "Sibling contract" exaggerates differences
** Experience same environment differently: Chance of events, choices and interpretation
* Gender
** Differences more in West, due to evolution/culture
** Stereotypes:
*** Cultural pressure

* Cause of behavior
** Unconscious mind
** Sexual/aggressive motives/drives
* Defensive styles
** Study of Vaillant: Less distortion means greater life success
** Repressors: Ones with less conscious anxiety, but body reacts stronger
* Defense mechanisms
** Reduce discomfort by unnacceptable thoughts/wishes/feelings
** Types:
*** Repression: Anxiety-producing thoughts are pushed out of the conscious mind.
*** Displacement: Unacceptable wish/drive redirected toward something more acceptable.
*** Sublimation: Variation of displacement where the alternative is something of value.
**** E.g. the wish to punish leads to become a laywer.
*** Reaction formation: Converting a frightening wish into its (safer) opposite.
*** Projection: A wish/drive is experienced as someone else's.
*** Rationalization: Use reasoning to explain away anxiety-provoking thoughts/feelings.

=== Humanistic

* Phenomenological reality
** How the self/world is perceived
* Maslow's hierarchy of needs
** Bottom-up with self-actualization at the top

=== Social-Cognitive

* Beliefs:
** Locus of Control: Internal versus external; reward for effort.
** Self-efficacy: Low versus high; belief in success
** Fixed versus malleable personality
** More success when: Internal locus, high self-efficacy and malleable
** Optimism: Cope better, whereas defensive optimism is harmful (besides adaptive pessimism)
** Chilren tend to be over-optimistic (more self-efficacy) which might improve performance
* DIAMONDS: 8 situation types, relates to personality
* Cultural
** When social environment differs, then beliefs/thinking differs
** Values: West = Individualist/Independence, East = Collectivist/Inter-dependence
** Non-Wester not match the big five, need their own tests

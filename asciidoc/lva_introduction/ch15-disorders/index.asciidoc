== Content

=== Basics & Identification

* Labeling = Diagnosis
** Essential for research and clinical use
** Labels refer to disorders, not to people (esteem effect)
* Syndrome = Interrelated Symptoms
* DSM-5
** Provides criteria for disorders: involuntary, internal, significant
** Reliability is OK, but validity is more complex to achieve
* Challenges
** Fuzzy concepts
** Watch out for "Medical student's disease"
* Cultural
** Culuture-bound syndroms
** West for example Anorexia/Bulimia Nervosa
** Justification
** E.g. homosexuality was 50 years ago still a disease in US/WHO
** Wide-spreadh like ADHD, because of emphasize on school performance and less play

=== Causes

* Possible from: Heredity, environment, learning
* Chronic / Episodic
** Chronic like: Down syndrome (Extra chromosome 21) or Alzheimer (plaques in brain); irreversible brain deficits
** All others mentioned here are episodic
* 3Ps
** Predisposing: Genetic, early environment, beliefs
** Precipitating (=sudden cause): stressful experience, loss
** Perpetuating (=sustain; penetrate time): self-care, asocial, other's reactions
* Sex: Prevelance differences
** Report versus suppress
** Clinician's expectations
** Social roles
** Stress response style

=== Anxiety

* Generalized Anxiety Disorder
** Increase since 1950s
** Hypervigilance: Automatic threat attention
** Worries: Enabled events, genes/trauma, imagined/real
* Phobias
** versus Fears = degree
** Aware of irrationality
** Target: Nonsocial objects, situations
** Natural selection
* Panic
** Panic attack: Helpless terror due to non-related event
** Arousal = Catastrophic (from exericse or coffein)

=== OCD

* Obsession = Repeated, disturbing thought
* Compulsion = Repetitive action as response to obsession
* Need for extreme safety
* Brain part where thought to action is done
* Impairment of executive function

=== PTSD

* Risk factors: Genetic, repeated exposure, inadequate social support
* Symptom: Substance abus, domestic violence, depression/anxiety, cognition deficits
* Antidot: Emotional self-regulation

=== Mood

* Depression
** Symptoms: Sadness, self-blame, worthlessness, pleasure absence
** Rumination: Focus on distress symptoms, worsen, negative thinking, interfere with problem solving
** Similar to anxiety: Same gene, often both in same person
** Hopelessness Theory: Stable & global cause
** Genetic predisposed and stressful event
** Reversible brain changes + distress
** When moderate it's adaptive: Repeat failure, loss loved, winter
* Bipolar
** Highly heritable
** "Maniac-Depressive" formerly called
** Manaic episodes: Euphory, high energy, talkative, self-confidence
** Full-blown mania: Poor judgement, bizarre thoughts, self-harm, risky behavior
** Hypomania leads to increased creativity (artists)

=== Schizophrenia

* Diagnostic, symptoms
** Classifications in 3:
*** Positive: Delusions (false beliefs), auditory hallucinations (own thoughts)
*** Disorganized: Illogical thought/speech, inappropriate behavior
*** Negative: Slow move, speech poverty, flat affect, loss drives/pleasure
** Can come in combination and can change
* Underlying
** Structural: enlarged cerebral ventricles; reduced neural mass due to pruning
** Brain chemistry: glutamate (decline effect), dopamine (unusual patterns)
** Cognitive: Long-term/working memory, attention
* Causes: Substantial heritability (concordance measure), brain injury (prenatal virus, malnutration, stress experience in family environment)
* Recovery: better in developing countries (social support, less drugs)

=== Personality

* Impaired yet stable behavior patterns of: Self, goal, empathy, intimacy
* Origins are unknown, yet to be researched (gene-environment?)
* Three clusters of: Odd, dramatic, anxious

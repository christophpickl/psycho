== Content

=== Impressing

* Impressions on the Internet
** When first date is online => 2nd date is better
*** Why: Less anxious, more intimate, no appearance bias
** Adolescents tend to do identity experiments
* Attributions
** On behavior
** Person's character versus the situation
** Person bias: Too much emphasize on character than situation
* Appearance
** More attractive thus: Smarter, socialer, competenter, moraler
** Baby-face (DiCaprio): Honester, naiver, helpesser, warmer, incompetenter

=== Self

* Through other's eye
** Pygmalion effect (a.k.a. "Self fulfilling prophecy"): Expectations create
** Sociometer theory: Self-esteem based on accepted by others
* Self-perception construction
** Social comparison by reference group ("Big fish in small pond" effect)
** Improve self-view
*** Self-serving attirbutions: Success = Me, Failure = Situation
*** Remember success more
*** Define own criteria for success
*** Happens mostly in the West
* Attitudes
** Equals: Beliefe/Opinion + Evaluation
** Types:
*** Explicit: Verbally stated
*** Implicit: Through experience/association; automatic influence
* Cognitive Dissonance
** Reduce discomfort: Set aside doubts; avoid dissonant information
** Insufficient justification effect: Only when freely done and little incentive
*** E.g. give someone money to do a shitty job

=== Groups

* In-Group versus Out-Group
* Stereotypes
** Equals: "Group schemas"
* Explicit versus Implicit
** Implicit association test
** Negative implicit stereotypes / Prejudice
*** Primitive emotions
*** Classical conditioning, thus positive associations

=== Observation and Evaluation

* Choking: Less performance due to audience
* Impression Management
** Influence other's perception, thus change own behavior
** Doing this (un)consciously
** Be like actors (playing roles) or politicians (promote agenda)
* Stereotype threat
** Remind about it before a task
** For stigmatized groups
*** Blacks on IQ tests
*** Women on math test
*** Men on art tests
* Thoughts distract due to limited working memory capacity
* Creating pressure

=== Conformity

Effects of other's examples, opinions and requests.

* Obedience as shown by Milgram's experiment
** Studied harm to others; experiment was considered rather unethical
** A bit of generalization (real crime, nazis)
** Factors: Role model, incremental, proximity, responsibility, norm of obedience
* Sales techniques: Low-ball, foot-in-the-door (to reduce cognitive dissonance)
* Group pressure via:
** Group-think: More cohesion, less truth
** Group polarization: More extreme as initially
* Experiment by Asch
** Group of judges (one real subject), guessing line size
** Agree to group although contradicting evidence
* Norms
** Desirable as normative, e.g. for public messages important (phrase it positively)
** Bystander effect
*** The more people, the less likely help; solution: Point to a specific person
*** Infomrational/Normative influences (e.g. which bridge to take)
** Emotional contagion
*** To unite and bond
*** Leaders are good at expressions

=== Social Dilemma

* Tragedy of the Commons
** The "cown on pasture" example
** Little difference for individual, collective effect
** Personal benefit at expense for others
** Harm for all, if all are selfish
* Accountability
** Increase cooperation; reputation
** Punish cheaters even at own (altruistic) expense
* Robbers Cave
** Solidarity within, yet negative stereotyping others
** Hostile interactions, reduced by superordinale goals, as cooperation is required
* Shared social identity
** Cooperation
** More within, less other group

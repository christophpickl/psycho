== Definitions

Psychology::
Science of behavior and mind. +
Etymologically from the Greek words link:https://www.etymonline.com/word/psyche[psykhē] (=breath, spirit, soul) and link:https://www.etymonline.com/word/-logy[logia] (=study of).

Behavior::
The *observable actions* (of a person/animal).

Mind::
Individual's *subjective experiences*, such as: Sensations, perceptions, memories, thoughts, dreams, motives, emotions...

Science::
Systematic *collection* and logical *analysis* of objectively observable *data* (plus inference of them).

== Fundamental Ideas

Before we had formal psychologist, there were: philosophers, physicists, physiologists, naturalists.

The 3 fundamental ideas on causation of behavior are:

. *Physical causes*, which can be studied scientifically, determine behavior and mental experiences.
** link:#sec-dualism[Dualism], link:#sec-materialism[materialism]; Body, matter, reflexes, link:#sec-brain_function_localization[localization]; Natural world.
. *Experience*: The *environment* is modifying over time our behavior, thoughts and feelings.
** (British) link:#sec-empiricism[Empiricism] VS link:#sec-nativism[Nativism]; blank slate, sensory, association; law of association by contiguity, complex thoughts
. *Evolution* produces the body's machinery, which produces behavior and mental experiences.
** Natural selection, survival/reproduction, function of behavior

[#sec-dualism]
== Dualism

* Definition:
** The body is like inanimate matter, can be studied scientifically.
** The mind is a supernatural entity, thus cannot be studied scientifically.
* Religious doctrine forbid challenge of dualism (possibly punished by death).

=== Descarte's Version

* link:../../people/descartes-rene.html[René Descartes], was the first who dared to challenge the dualistic view.
* He saw the body as a complex machine, not necessarily needing a soul to operate.
** Thus called a: "_machine-oriented version of dualism_" (more focus on body).
* His understanding of nerves and reflexes (threads and fluids) come very close to our current understanding.
* He concluded, if a dog can do human activities (eat, sleep, drink, occasionally going in circles), and a dog has no soul, then some of our activities are purely mechanically as well.
* BUT: Humans have one essential ability, which is *thinking*, a là: "_Cogito, ergo sum_".
* Thinking soul was located in a small organ in the brain (nowadays called the pineal gland).
* His theory is still popular today, as it doesn't violate with religious beliefs and intuitive feelings.
* BUT: It has serious *limitations*:
** Philosophical: How can a non-material entity (soul) have an effect on a material one (body)?
** Philosophical: How can the body follow natural laws, yet be moved by a soul which does not?
** Psychological: Thought (and behavior guided by it) are the products by a willful soul, thus cannot be scientifically studied.

[#sec-materialism]
== Materialism

* English philosopher link:../../people/hobbes-thomas.html[Thomas Hobbes] was going even further.
* He came up with the idea of *Materialism*:
** The soul (or "spirit" as he called it) is a meaningless concept.
** Nothing exists but matter and energy (pure bodily).
* The consequences of this are:
** All human behavior can be understood in terms of physical processes in the body (brain).
** Everything is subject to natural laws.
** There is no (theoretical) limit to psychological scientific studies.
* This lead to the inspiration to a next school of thought: *Empiricism*

.A 17th century mechanical, humanoid clock. Like computers today, a symbol of technological achievement, which inspired Descartes and Hobbes of their view of a mechanical human.

== Man as a Machine

[#sec-reflexology]
=== Reflexology

* Early 18th century, considerable progress in *physiology*: The study of the body's machinery.
* Especially the nervous system and reflexes.
** Understanding of reflexes was important for the emergence of psychology.
** CNS (Central Nervous System) consisting of brain and spinal cord.
** PNS (Peripheral Nervous System) connecting the CNS with sense organs and muscles.
** Spinal cord containing two pathways:
*** Afferent/Sensory: From sensory receptors to the CNS.
*** Efferent/Motor: From CNS to the muscles.
* Simple reflexes are based on neural connections.
** Certain brain areas (when active) can enhance/inhibit such reflexes.
* Reflexology: All human behavior is determined by (complex) reflexes, stimulated by the environment.
** By russian physiologist I. M. Sechenov, who later inspired link:../../people/pavlov-ivan.html[Pavlov]'s work.

[#sec-brain_function_localization]
=== Brain Function Localization

* 19th century another advance in physiology: Specific brain parts serve specific functions.
** Different sensory experiences, by different sense organs, excite different parts.
* link:../../people/broca-paul.html[Paul Broca] found evidence, damage to an area (named after him) would lose ability to speak, but not lose other mental abilities.
* This relationship of mind and body gave basis to the idea of a material basis for mental processes.
** Some took it even that far (Franz Joseph Gall) that by feeling bumps on the skull, they could infer size of various areas, thus describe a person's psychological characteristics.
A pseudoscience called "Phrenology"

.An extreme: *Phrenology*, claiming identify personality based on skull surface.
image::images/phrenology_localization.jpg[Phrenology,300,100]

[#sec-empiricism]
== Empiricism

* 17th century in England, the school of thought of *British empiricism* emerged by the materialist philosophy.
* Represented by link:../../people/locke-john.html[John Locke], link:../../people/hume-david.html[David Hume], link:../../people/hobbes-thomas.html[Thomas Hobbes], Francis Bacon as well as John Stuart Mill (Utilitarianism).
* It states: All knowledge and thought are derived from sensory experience.
** The *Law of Association by Contiguity* (initially by Aristotle) states that: Two events contiguously (same, or right after) will be associated (bound together) in the mind, thus in the future, when one event occurs the other will be provoked.
* A child's mind is blank ("*Tabula Rasa*"), and experience writes on it, fills the blank slate.
** Locke also referred to the mind as a "unfurnished room".
** Thus: There is no "human nature", we only adapt our behavior to demands of the environment.

.*Law by Contiguity*: Empiricism states that an apple is a complex idea, consisting of many sensations like shape, color and taste.
image::images/law_by_contiguity-apple.jpg[Law by Contiguity,300,100]

[#sec-nativism]
== Nativism

* The anti-movement to Empiricism.
* We do have an innate ability to learn.
** Especially the inborn ability to learn language.
* Biggest represent is link:../../people/kant-immanuel.html[Kant]:
** A priori (with birth) VS a posteriori (learning) knowledge.
** We get born with a "pre-furnished room" on the basis of Locke's metaphor.

[#sec-evolution]
== Evolution

* All about survival and reproduction.
* Natural selection supports nativism view.
* All about random changes (mutations).
** Function of behavior.
** Adaptation to environment.

== Scopes, Level of Analysis

We can identify 9 level of causal analysis (they complement and integrate each other), whereas the first 4 are biological, the others are not:

[width="70%"]
[cols="1,10,1"]
|=======
|Area |Description |Cause

|*Neural* |behavioral/cognitive neuroscience, EEG/PET, fMRT, brain areas (active / inhibit / damage) |Brain
|*Physiological* |biopsychology (physiological psychology); growth, emotions | internal chemical functions (hormones/drugs)
|*Genetic* |behavioral genetics; modification; compare DNA (genes correlate => similar traits), twins |Genes
|*Evolutionary* |why evolved/actual routes; function/benefit (survive+reproduce) |Natural Selection
|*Learning* |modifiable by experiences; learning (behavioral) psychology | Experience from environment
|*Cognitive* |un/conscious thoughts/beliefs/memories; never measured, only inferred (experience -> knowledge -> behavior) |Knowledge, believe
|*Social* |cooperative animals; other perception/approval; role models; social conformity/norms/pressure/cognition |Influence of others
|*Cultural* |culture = group's customs/beliefs; broader than social psychology (history, economy, religion, philosophy) |Surrounding culture
|*Developmental* |predict by age; sequence of changes; language development |Age-related changes
|=======

Other specialities can be grouped by topic (rather level of analysis), like: Sensory psychology, psychology of motivation, personality psychology, abnormal psychology, et cetera.

[#sec-scientific_revolution]
== Scientific Revolution

It all began in *ancient Greece*:

* "Know thyself", as written at the shrine of the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, 600 BC.
* Aristotle: "all knowledge is attained through experience" => Empiricism
* After Greeks, nothing happened until 15th (Renaissance) and 18th (Enlightenment) century.

Then it turned into a *mature science*:

* Psychology became a formal, recognized, scientific discipline in 1879.
* In Leipzig, link:../../people/wundt-wilhelm.html[Wilhelm Wundt] opened the first university-based psychology laboratory.
* *Professions* include:
** Academic: Research
** Clinical: Health, hospital
** School: Supervision
** Business: Recruitment
** Government: Counseling

It's a *hub science* connecting the three other sciences:

. Natural Sciences
. Social Sciences
. Humanities

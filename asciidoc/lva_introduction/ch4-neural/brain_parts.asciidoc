= Brain Parts

== Introduction

* Brain is about 60% fat (myelin sheath), rest is water, protein, carbs and salts.
* It contains blood vessels and nerves, including neurons and glial cells (Glia = Greek for glue).
* Neuron (nerve cell) consists of a body (soma), dendrites (receivers) and axons (senders).
** They are sometimes wrapped in a myelin sheath (protection, and fastens transmission 35x).
* Gray matter are the neurons' bodies (lack insulation), white matter are their axons:

* The brain is covered in with different layers called "Meninges":

=== Terminology

* *Cortex* = Latin for "bark"
* *Gyri* = Ridges
* *Sulci* = Folds

=== Functional Parts of the Nervous System

. *CNS*: Central Nervous System; brain and spinal cord
. *PNS*: Peripheral Nervous System; transports messages to/from CNS
.. *SNS*: Somatic Nervous System; afferent/sensory (info to CNS) and efferent/motor (voluntary muscles)
.. *ANS*: Autonomic Nervous System; involuntary body functions (glands, heart, digestion, breath, sweat, ...); sensing internal functions
... *SNS*: Sympathetic Nervous System; fight & flight; activate/arouse body, expend energy
... *PSNS*: Parasympathetic Nervous System; rest & digest; calm body, conserve/maintain energy
.. *Ganglia*: Neurons (somata and dendrites) in PNS forming plexus; relay center

== Parts

=== Hindbrain

*Hindbrain*: Oldest, most primitive and lowest brain part.

. *Spinal Cord* (upper part): Connects brain with rest of the body; simple reflexes
. *Brainstem*: vital life functions; connects to spinal cord
.. *Midbrain*: See next section.
.. *Pons*: Sleep, arousal; carries lower/higher nervous system impulses
.. *Medulla (Oblongata)*: Regulates vital functions (breath, heart rate/circulation)
. *Cerebellum*: (fine) muscle movements, co-ordination, balance; learning, memory

=== Midbrain

*Midbrain*: Reflexes, eye movements; Cluster of sensory/motor neurons (relay visual/auditory); Uppermost part of the brainstem

. *Reticular Formation*: A gate keeper, allowing stimulus/messages go forward/block through brain stem; e.g. stimulation of sleep/arousal
. *Substantia nigra*: for reward/movement
. *Colliculi*: Superior and inferior part
. *PAG*: Peri-Aqueductal Gray, a neural center in the midbrain for pain inhibition.

=== Forebrain

*Forebrain*: Most advanced/developed (from evolutionary standpoint); also largest, anterior part

.The forebrain from the side.

. *Cerebrum*: Upper brain part; divided into 2 hemispheres; seat of motor/sensory functions and higher mental functions (consciousness, thought, reason, emotion, memory); largest brain part
. *Hemispheres*: left = language/math, positive emotions; right = spatial, negative emotions; (see: split brain patients, cut through central sulcus)
.. *Corpus Callosum*: Neural bridge between both; ("_hemispheric lateralization_": left/right forebrain separation, allowing specialization, greater localization of a function in L/R)
. *Hypothalamus*: motivation/emotion (aggression); regulate basic biological needs (eat/drink, sleep, sex, body temperature); controls hormones, metabolism
.. *Nucleus Accumbens*: Motivationally-relevant stimuli (reward; limbic-motor interface); function still not fully understood
. *Pituitary Gland*: The "master gland" (organizing others), store/release (hypothalamus) and produce hormones (ant./post.)
. *Limbic System*: satisfy desires/urges, motivation; co-ordinate behavior/actions according hypothalamus; memory (formerly known as "rhinencephalon", meaning "nose brain")
.. *Thalamus*: "switchboard / relay center", organizing incoming sensory inputs and sends to specific brain areas
.. *Amygdala*: motivation, emotional response (aggression, fear; alarm); almond shaped
.. *Hippocampus*: "_memory hub_" ðŸ¦› store/retrieve memories; learning
*** also spatial memory enabling navigation ("how to get around the campus? via the hippocampus")

.Primary Motor/Sensory Area.

== Lobes

.The four lobes of the brain.

. *Frontal*: Planning, future, reasoning, short-term storage; behind the forehead; rearmost portion is motor area; left one is Broca's area
. *Parietal*: Smelling, tasting, touch, temperature, movement; reading, arithmetic; just behind motor area are sensory areas
. *Temporal*: Hearing and remembering sound; front of visual areas, under frontal/parietal lobes
. *Occipital*: Visual, image processing

== Other Structures

* *Cerebral Cortex*: Wrinkled outer (0.6cm) brain part, coating surface (gray matter = unmyelinated) of cerebrum and cerebellum; "Crowning feature" of brain development
* *PreFrontalCortex* (PFC): Plan, self-control, executive functions; behind forehead; latest part (matured by 20 years)
* *Primary Motor Cortex*: Voluntary movement (controls 600+ muscles)
* *Somatosensory Motor Cortex*: receives sensory input (heat, touch, temp, balance, kinesthesis)
** Kinesthesis = Movement; Proprioception = Position

* *Pineal Gland*: Regulating hormonal functions, produces melatonin (circadian rhythm); size of a rice corn, between lobes of Thalamus
* *Broca's area*: Speech production; frontal (left) lobe near motor cortex
* *Wernicke's area*: Speech recognization; close to ear
* *Basal Ganglia*: Nerve clusters around Thalamus; initiating/integrating movements (see Parkinson's)
* *Arcuate Nucelus* (ARC): Part of hypothalamus.
Hormones, especially leptin (hunger! energy balance, insulin).
* *Suprachiasmatic Nucelus* (SCN): Part of hypothalamus.
Sleep (circadian pacemaker).

* *Brain Matter*: The white matter is (mostly) axons, whereas the gray matter are the cell bodies.

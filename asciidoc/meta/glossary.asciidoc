= Glossary

== Brainy

The following terms are often used interchangeably and without proper, precise meaning assigned by most people. Yet, they do have distinct meanings.

* *Cognitive*: Learning/acquiring knowledge, understanding through thought/experience/senses.
** Including: Perception, memory, judgment, reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making.
* *Intellectual*: The ability to think logically, reason, understand complex ideas.
** Using higher-order thinking skills, critical analysis; engaging in a philosophical debate requires intellectual effort and analytical thinking.
* *Mental*: All activities with the mind, a broader umbrella term including: Cognitive functions, emotions, attitudes and mental health.
* *Psychological*: The study of the mind/behavior, encompassing mental/emotional states.
** Covers: Cognition, emotion, behavior, personality, mental health.

== Rationality

Rationality and reason are closely related concepts, but they have distinct meanings and applications.

* *Rationality*: Quality/state of being reasonable, based on facts/reason.
** To adhere to logic and consistency, thinking coherently.
** Using logic/evidence to make decisions/form beliefs.
** Example: A rational person uses statistical data to make an informed decision about buying a car.
* *Reason*: The ability of the mind to think/understand/form judgments logically.
** The mental process of deriving logical conclusions from premises/evidence (drawing inferences, make sense of experiences, establish truth).
** Using reason, we can deduce that you are mortal.

Rationality is broader, about thinking quality and decision-making; consistency, coherence, using logic; adherence to logical principles.
Reason means to think logically, understand, and form judgments. The actual mental activity of processing information logically to come to conclusions.

Examples:

* A person demonstrating rationality might avoid gambling because they understand the statistical improbability of winning.
* A person using reason might analyze a set of arguments, weigh the evidence, and conclude which argument is more logically sound.


== Science Terminology

* *Hypothesis*: A statement which is possible and needs further validation to be proven.
Usually the conditions are stated as well which are needed for validation.
* *Theory*: By verifying a hypothesis through empirical observations a new theory formed, like relativity theory or evolution theory.
* *Thesis*: A claim which should be proven/disproven by means of scientific evidence.

== Logic

* *Deduction*: Drawing conclusions from a set of premises (which are assumed to be true). Reasoning from the general to the specific.
** Example: Premise 1, all men are mortal; Premise 2, I am a man; Conclusion, therefore I am mortal.
** IF the premises are true, AND the logic is valid, THEN the conclusion must be true.
** It is very safe (compared to induction) yet doesn't lead to necessarily "groundbreaking" new insights. A more conservative approach.
* *Induction*: Making generalizations based on specific observations/instances. Reasoning from the specific to the general.
** Example: Observation 1, sun has risen everyday east; Observation 2, sun rose east today; Conclusion, sun will rise east tomorrow.
** Inductive arguments provide probable conclusions (likely to be true, but not guaranteed).
* Key differences Deduction/Induction:
** Deduction: from general to specific (induction other way round).
** Deduction has certainty, induction is probable (based on evidence).
** Induction reveals new knowledge (deduction only scratches the surface a bit).
** Deduction used in math, inductive reasoning in (empirical) sciences and everyday life (observing patters, formulate hypotheses).
*** Induction example: I give her a rose, she looks angry, thus I conclude she doesn't like roses.
* *Axiom* (postulate, assumption): A statement that is considered to be true, and to be used for further reasoning and arguments as a premise.

Don't Say:

. "I have to make my partner *happy*."
. "My partner should make me *feel good* about myself."
. "We should *always* feel in love."
. "Our relationship should be *easy*."
. "We can't let anything about our dynamic *change*."

Instead, Try:

. "Only I am *responsible* for how I feel about myself."
. "Feelings will *change* over time; that's OK."
. "A good bond takes *time and work*."
. "Our relationship will *grow and evolve*."

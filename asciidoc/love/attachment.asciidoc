== Background

=== Diagnose

These are some signs indicating that you are insecurely attached:

* Need to *control* your partner
** "Clingy behavior (texting all the time) to protect myself from abandonment.
* Need for frequent *validation*/praise
** Words of appreciation; giving love in order to get love back -be frustrated if not
* Feeling *insecure* for no obvious reason
* Being hyper-vigilant, mind-reading, *psychoanalysing
** Looking for any subtle cue, out of fear, to be abandoned
* Staying in *unhealthy* relationships

Furthermore:

* Unable to hear *feedback*, interpreting it as criticism, getting defensive.
* When people have a different opinion, *disagreeing* with me, feeling rejected.
* *Interpreting* everything that happens through a lens of traumatic experiences.
* Anxiety -> Self-preservation *strategies*: clinging, jealousy, criticizing, rejecting -> self-fulfilling prophecy -> reinforcing belief "_nobody is safe/trustworthy_", "everybody leaves me at the end"

Left *unaddressed*, old memories will continue alter how I *perceive* others/myself.

=== Trauma

* *Childhood* wasn't safe, no emotional support.
** Developed *strategies* to stay safe, which are not serving me anymore.
** Those psychological coping mechanisms, became my biology (brain)
** No explicit, conscious information stored, but *implicit*, emotional memory
** A temporary state, became a long-term *trait*: Dysfunction/pathology
** Using *outdated scripts* to "predict" the future
* Identifying and *understanding* the mechanics underneath help me to improve

== Becoming Securely Attached

Give some love to my inner child... being abandoned gives low self-esteem; not good enough.
Narcissism is a way to get this missed out love/appreciation/validation. Being seen.

Order: 1) me within myself 2) I do it to others 3) I ask it from others.

=== Areas to Grow

* *Mindfulness*: Becoming aware of implicit, emotional memories.
** *Separating* old stuff from what's happening at the moment.
* *Accept* anxiety being a natural experience to vulnerability
* Eliminate *mind-reading*, projecting my expectations
** Rejecting person VS rejecting behaviors (or nothing with me to do at all)
* *Communicate* openly, be transparent (others can't read my mind)
* Eliminate catastrophic *all-nothing* thinking ("_minor mistake will be the end_")
* Evaluate accuracy of my *thoughts* (in this context, this person, this moment)
* Identify and address my abandonment *triggers*
* Explore my needs for a *safe* relationships
* Have healthy *boundaries* with reciprocal adjustments
** Don't overwhelm others with my love/needs (iina); *moderation*!

=== Find Stability Within

To start to learn what a healthy relationship feels like, develop a *secure attachment* with myself:

// TODO: picture of marcus aurelius

* Be *consistent*, predictability (not chaotic)
* Be *responsive* and mindful
* Be *attentive* and loving
* Be *validating* and (non-judgmentally) accepting (emotions); mindfulness
* Be *encouraging*, nurturing for self-efficacy
* Be *supportive* and forgiving
* Be *safe*, by setting healthy boundaries/realistic expectations
* Be unconditionally *loving* to myself

=== Find Stability with Others

* *Friends* are people with whom I do not have sex with.
* To *reach out* when in needs; e.g.: brunch with friend was very good.
* "_Nachlehrung_": Gain correcting relationship *experiences*.
** In childhood were some impairments...
** *Self-efficacy* available, now I can decide based on this knowledge/insight.

== Concrete Doings

* Mindful Self-Compassion / ACT
**  Resistance is against those (new age) people, not the method itself
** https://self-compassion.org/self-compassion-practices/#guided-practices
* Imaginationen
** access to own fantasy; find safe place to retreat (wohl/geborgen)
* Heart Coherence exercise (6-1 cycle)
** e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAI1OH1NNlU&list=PL9rlR6zIwFY4ZoOJMdLo-3Fl1PvPAeN6-&index=1

=== Journal Prompts

* Similarities *bad* relationships? How *avoid*/address those pitfalls?
** Need to be needed to avoid abandonment: "I'm unloveable, thus people are only going to be with me when they need me", making the dependent on me.
* *Good* ones, how were they different?
* What does *trust* mean to me?
* What do I *need* in relationships to feel safe?
* How does my low *self-esteem* prevent from believing people value me?
* How can older me, start being a safe person, for my younger me/inner child?

Relationship Processing Activity:

* Write my autobiography and reflect on past relationships
** How abandoned? How interpret/understand then? Understand differently now/could?
** What was my behavior I used to stay safe (programming the inner child)?
** How impacted my ability to trust others/myself? That I'm loveable?
** Do I abandon myself (neglecting myself, making myself indispensable to others)?

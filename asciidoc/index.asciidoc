= Welcome to the PsyWiki ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ì

"_In the seek of *truth*, not of comfort._"

And may this search lead us to less ignorance, as:

"_We often fear what we don't *understand*. Our best defence is *knowledge*._"

== About

The *purpose* of this wiki is primarily to collect, organize, and summarize all the knowledge acquired during my personal psychology study. It initially started with being a formal student at the link:https://www.ou.nl[Open University Netherlands], but I decided not to proceed with such a rigid, academic approach, and instead to my own way, yet being inspired (overall structure of lectures, book choices, etc).

Yet, the content started to go way beyond that, and contains now material which simply caught my interest, and I sometimes feel the urge to hold on, not being able to let go of lists of certain topics, such as cognitive biases and VIP in this domain.

May you experience the same pleasure as I did while studying the vast knowledge about the human mind. Never stop to think deeply, my fellow homo sapiens philosopher.

== Content

Currently most of the content exists for the following subjects:

* link:lva_introduction/index.html[Introduction to Psychology]
* link:lva_clinical/index.html[Clinical Psychology]
* link:lva_social/index.html[Social Psychology]

Everything else is mostly link:universiteit/index.html[university related] content, besides a list of very important link:people/index.html[people], as well as a collection of link:phenomena/index.html[phenomena] containing fascinating studies, experiments, real life cases, biases and other fascinating stuff.

The link:meta/index.html[meta discussions] cover topics not directly related to psychology but still touch it on another level.
For any further reading have a look at the collection of link:resources/index.html[resources].

= Welcome to the PsyWiki ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ì

"_In the seek of truth, not of comfort._"

== Abstract

The *purpose* of this wiki is to collect and organize all the information learned during my study at the link:https://www.ou.nl[Open University Netherlands].

== Content

Currently, *most of the content* is being written for the "link:introduction/index.html[Introduction to Psychology]" class.

Everything else is mostly link:universiteit/index.html[university related] content, besides a list of link:people/index.html[very important people], as well as a collection of link:phenomena/index.html[phenomena] containing fascinating studies, experiments, real life cases, biases and other fascinating stuff.

The link:meta/index.html[meta discussions] cover topics not directly related to psychology but still touch it on another level.
For any further reading have a look at the collection of link:resources/index.html[resources].

*Work in progress* sections cover link:/clinical/index.html[mental disorders], the different link:schools/index.html[schools in psychology].
